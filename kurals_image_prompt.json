On the left path, the person is shown struggling to climb out of a dark pit of 'Vice' ('Maraththirkum'). The same figure of 'Love' is shown reaching down into the pit, providing a strong grip ('Thunai') to help pull the person out.\n- Surrounding scene: The path of virtue is clear and bright. The pit of vice is dark, thorny, and filled with symbols of wrongdoing.\n- Symbolic details: This composition directly refutes the 'unwise' notion that love only helps virtue. Love is depicted as a universal, powerful force, equally capable of sustaining the good and redeeming the fallen. The hand of light is identical in both scenarios, emphasizing that its nature does not change.\n- Lighting: The scene of virtue is bright and golden. The pit of vice is dark and shadowy.

This light does not harm the other, loving people around him.\n- Surrounding scene: For comparison, a small, boneless creature like a worm ('Enbu Ilathanai') is shown on the hot ground, shriveling under the fierce sun ('Veyil'). This provides a direct visual parallel.\n- Symbolic details: The intense light that burns the loveless man is the light of 'Virtue' ('Aram'). For those with love, this light is nurturing. For him, who lacks the 'bones' of love and compassion, it is a destructive, burning force. His form is shown slowly turning to dust under its glare.\n- Lighting: A powerful, piercing sun represents the force of Virtue. For most of the scene, its light is beautiful and life-giving.

As he is about to do this, his own heart ('Than Nenjam') projects a terrifying vision before him.\n- Surrounding scene: An office or marketplace setting.\n- Symbolic details: The vision projected by his conscience is of himself in a state of utter ruin—his wealth turned to ashes, his home destroyed, his reputation shattered. This vision is the embodiment of the thought 'I shall perish' ('Keduval Yaan'). The man recoils in fear from his own intended action, warned by his own mind of the inevitable consequence of injustice.\n- Lighting: The present scene is lit normally.

At the same time, they can see their ultimate goal in the distance.\n- Surrounding scene: The path of life. In the distance, a magnificent, glowing, celestial city represents the 'higher pleasures' of heaven or liberation ('Matrinbam').\n- Symbolic details: Because their desire is fixed on the great, ultimate goal, the small, earthly temptation holds no power over them. They do not even glance at the trifling fruit as they walk past, their eyes set on the glorious city. They will not commit an 'unjust act' ('Aranalla') for something so insignificant when their aim is so high.\n- Lighting: The earthly pleasure has a small, fleeting glow.

Behind the mask, his true face is demonic.

The other path is 'death' ('Saadhal').\n- Surrounding scene: A spiritual, otherworldly crossroads.\n- Symbolic details: The path of a false life is thorny and leads to a pit of shame. The path of death, in this specific context, is shown leading to a more honorable outcome. As the Kural states, death is the better option that brings the 'gain of virtuous good'. This is visualized as the path of death leading towards a neutral, peaceful light, while the false life leads to darkness. It is a stark choice between a dishonorable life and an honorable end.\n- Lighting: The path of the false life is shrouded in a sickly, deceptive gloom.

This heart of benevolence is shown to outshine all the other treasures of both worlds, establishing it as the supreme good.\n- Lighting: The crowns and gold have a worldly, yellow gleam.

He desperately wants to give, but his 'inability to do the good deeds' he wishes ('Seyyumneera Seyyaathu') is his only true suffering.

The person is shown willingly 'selling himself' into servitude ('Vitrukkol') in order to acquire the means to perform the benevolent act.

One chooses to give, the other to receive.\n- Action: The painting presents two hypothetical paths. One path, labeled 'Receiving' ('Kolal'), is shown leading to a beautiful heaven, but the path itself is depicted as dark and shameful. The other path, labeled 'Giving' ('Eethal'), is shown leading to a simple, empty space (implying 'no upper heaven'), but the path itself is brilliant, noble, and virtuous.\n- Surrounding scene: A spiritual landscape of choice.\n- Symbolic details: The Kural's philosophy is visualized. Even if receiving leads to heaven, the act itself is 'ill' ('Theethu'), so the path is ignoble. Even if giving leads to no celestial reward, the act itself is so inherently 'good' ('Nandru') that the path shines with its own virtue. The focus is on the inherent quality of the act, not the outcome.

His spiritual 'power' ('Aatral') is considerable, represented by a strong aura of light. On the left, a charitable householder is shown 'relieving the hunger' of the poor ('Appasiyai Maatruvaar') by distributing food.\n- Surrounding scene: An ascetic's hermitage and a public place of charity.\n- Symbolic details: While the ascetic's power is great, the power of the charitable householder is shown to be even greater. His aura of spiritual light is larger, brighter, and more powerful. He is placed slightly 'in front' ('Pin') of the ascetic on the path of virtue, signifying that the power to give is superior to the power to endure.\n- Lighting: The ascetic has a strong, silver-white light of self-control.

This is 'exalted fame' ('Uyarndha Pukazh'), which is visualized as a single, magnificent, towering pillar of pure, white light. It is unaffected by the winds of time that have destroyed everything else around it.

In this celestial realm, sages and celestial beings ('Pulavarai') are normally being praised and adored.\n- Symbolic details: As the light of the virtuous person's fame from Earth reaches the heavens, the Gods and other celestial beings are shown turning their attention away from their own sages and looking down towards Earth with awe and admiration. The praise ('Potraadhu') for their own celestial inhabitants ceases, as it is completely overshadowed by the glory of the virtuous soul on Earth.\n- Lighting: The heavens have a beautiful, celestial light.

This 'body of fame' is immortal and glorious. The painting shows that this exchange—losing the mortal body to gain an immortal one of fame—is a 'gain' and a form of 'life's true bliss fulfilled'. This difficult, paradoxical achievement is possible only for the truly wise and great.\n- Lighting: The mortal body and the scene of death are in shadow, representing loss.

This wiser self is not pointing at the critics, but is pointing back at the person themselves, urging them to 'blame themselves' ('Than Novaar') for their own failures. The source of the pain is not the external scorn, but their own 'inability' to live a praiseworthy life.\n- Lighting: A harsh, critical light from the scorners shines on the person.

This is visualized literally. While virtuous people who pass away leave behind a beautiful, glowing child made of light (their legacy of fame), this person leaves behind nothing. This lack of a legacy is regarded by the wise elders as a great 'fault' or 'disgrace' ('Vasaiyenpa').

Illai'). Kindness is visualized as a gentle, glowing bird of light that is trying to rest on his shoulder, but the act of eating flesh creates a dark, repulsive aura that frightens the bird away. The parallel is direct: neglecting wealth leads to material poverty; eating flesh leads to spiritual poverty.\n- Lighting: The scene on the left is dim and decaying.

It is personified by a gentle figure protecting a deer, the act of 'not killing' ('Kollaamai'). On the right side, 'Lack of Kindness' ('Arulallathu') is defined. It is personified by a hunter 'killing' the deer ('Koral').\n- Surrounding scene: A forest.\n- Symbolic details: The painting extends the definition.

The painting creates a direct, unbreakable chain of logic: Killing is the opposite of grace, and eating meat is the direct result of killing, therefore eating meat is an act devoid of virtue.\n- Lighting: The scene of non-killing and grace is bathed in a warm, pure, and life-affirming golden light.

Priests are pouring vast quantities of ghee ('Avi Sorinthu') into magnificent ritual fires. The act is complex and impressive. On the right, a single, simple person is shown performing one, quiet act: refusing a piece of meat and choosing to 'not kill or eat' ('Uyirseguthu Unnaamai').\n- Surrounding scene: A grand temple complex on the left, a humble home on the right.\n- Symbolic details: The spiritual merit of both actions is visualized.

First, he is shown calmly 'enduring his own suffering' ('Utranoi Nondral'), symbolized by the harsh sun beating down on him and the rocky ground he sits on, which he bears without complaint. Second, he is shown 'not causing harm to any other creature' ('Uyirkkurukan Seyyaamai'), visualized by him gently allowing ants to crawl over his hand without disturbing them.\n- Surrounding scene: A solitary, austere, natural setting.\n- Symbolic details: These two actions together form the 'type' or 'nature' ('Kuru') of true penance.

The successful ascetic is shown having practiced similar disciplines in a past life, which has given him the spiritual strength for this one.

His own 'mind' or 'heart' ('Than Nenjam') is shown to be aware of his secret 'guilt' ('Kutrap Padin'). This inner knowledge is visualized as a dark, thorny vine that is tightly coiled around his heart, causing him immense, hidden pain. His lofty appearance is shown to be a hollow shell that brings him no peace, making it useless ('Evanseyyum?').\n- Lighting: A brilliant, majestic, golden light shines on the man's external form, representing his public fame.

The person is revealed to be a timid 'cow' that has simply draped a 'tiger's skin' ('Puliyin Thol') over itself.

Despite its straightness, its purpose is cruel—it is depicted piercing a target. Below it is a person who looks outwardly righteous and 'straight', but is performing a cruel deed. On the right, a 'curved lute' or yaazh ('Yaazhkodu') is shown. Despite its crooked shape, its purpose is to create beautiful, 'sweet' music.

In the background, a vision shows that if he were to steal, the people of the world would point and despise him.

Their one act of vengeful harm, even against an enemy, has doomed them to a future of grief from which there is no escape.\n- Lighting: The scene starts with the unjust darkness of the enemy's hatred.

It is so unexpected and noble that it completely disarms the wrongdoer and makes them feel profound 'shame' ('Naana') for their own actions. This shame is visualized as the wrongdoer being unable to look at the virtuous person, their face burning with the realization of their own smallness in the face of such great character.\n- Lighting: A dark, ugly light surrounds the wrongdoer.

The gnomon (the part that casts the shadow) of the sundial is not a simple pointer but is the blade of a great, invisible 'saw' ('Vaaladhu').

First, the ascetic is 'destroying' the power of their 'five senses' ('Adalvendum Aindhan Pulaththai'). This is visualized as five sensory pathways (eyes, ears, etc.) being consciously closed off by an act of will. Second, they are 'abandoning all they have ever desired' ('Vidalvendum Ventiya Vellaam').\n- Surrounding scene: A place of absolute solitude.\n- Symbolic details: The past desires are shown as a vast collection of worldly objects and relationships behind the ascetic. With a single, powerful act of will, the ascetic causes this entire collection to turn to dust and blow away. The two acts—the inner renunciation of the senses and the outer renunciation of all desired objects—are shown happening at the same moment ('Orungu'), representing a complete and total break from the world.\n- Lighting: A powerful, explosive, white light of pure will emanates from the ascetic as they perform this total renunciation.

On the right, another ascetic is shown holding on to even a single, small 'possession' ('Udaimai').\n- Surrounding scene: A stark, minimalist landscape.\n- Symbolic details: The single possession held by the ascetic on the right is shown to be a source of 'bewilderment' and confusion ('Mayalaakum'). It creates a swirling, misty fog of attachment around their head, preventing them from achieving the clear-sighted peace of the other ascetic. The painting illustrates that even one small attachment is enough to corrupt the state of penance.\n- Lighting: The ascetic with nothing is bathed in a clear, pure, and unobstructed white light of wisdom.

If the body itself is such a huge burden, these other, lesser attachments are completely insignificant and must be dropped without a second thought.\n- Lighting: The ascetic and the path upwards are lit with a struggling but hopeful light.

First, the scholar is with the group, and his presence and words bring them visible 'joy' ('Uvappath Thalaikkoodi'). The atmosphere is happy and enlightened. Second, the scholar is shown departing.\n- Surrounding scene: A pleasant gathering place, like a garden or a courtyard.\n- Symbolic details: As the scholar leaves, he doesn't just leave an empty space. He leaves behind a beautiful, glowing aura of thoughtful contemplation ('Ullap Pirithal'). The people he is leaving are not sad, but are shown with thoughtful, inspired expressions, pondering his words and already looking forward to his return. The 'art of the scholar' ('Pulavar Thozhil') is to enrich people both in their presence and in their absence.\n- Lighting: During the meeting, the light is warm, joyful, and communal.

First, he is shown looking into a mirror and carefully 'curing his own faults' ('Thankutram Neekki'). The faults are dark spots on his reflection, which he is wiping away. Second, having purified himself, he turns his attention to 'scanning the faults of other men' ('Pirarkutrang Kaankirpin'), addressing the problems in his kingdom.\n- Surrounding scene: His royal court.\n- Symbolic details: Because he has first corrected himself, his judgment of others is clear and just. The Kural's question 'What fault will remain in him?' ('Enkutram Aakum?') is answered visually: he is shown to be completely 'faultless'. His body is depicted as being made of pure, clear crystal, with no internal flaws, making him a perfect vessel for justice.\n- Lighting: The act of self-correction is lit with a clear, honest, white light.

However, the loaders are 'heaping them too high' ('Saala Miguththup Peyin'). Despite the individual lightness of each feather, the massive, accumulated volume puts too much strain on the cart, and the 'axle snaps in twain' ('Achirum'). The painting is a beautiful, striking visual metaphor for how even a series of seemingly insignificant tasks or burdens can lead to a catastrophic breaking point if they become too numerous.\n- Lighting: The peacock feathers are iridescent and beautifully lit. The moment the axle breaks is a dramatic, sharp, and catastrophic event, with a harsh light focusing on the snapping wood and the beautiful cargo tumbling into a chaotic mess.\n- Style: Photorealistic for human and natural elements, mystical painterly effects for symbolic aspects.\n- Orientation: Landscape, ultra-wide, cinematic scope.",

This one, final, overreaching act causes the branch to snap, and they are shown plummeting towards the 'end of their life' ('Uyirkkirudhi'). The painting is a stark warning about knowing one's limits and the fatal danger of over-ambition.\n- Lighting: The scene is lit with the bright, high-altitude light of the treetop.

They are giving water to the needy, but they are doing so wisely, 'knowing the measure' ('Alavarindhu') of what they can afford to give without draining the lake. They are using a reasonably sized vessel to give, not opening the entire floodgate. This careful, measured charity is the 'way to guard and preserve one's wealth' ('Porul Potri Vazhangu Neri').

However, the 'outgoing' stream ('Pokaaru'), representing expenditure, is even smaller, and is 'not wider' than the income.\n- Surrounding scene: The kingdom's treasury is represented as a reservoir.\n- Symbolic details: Because the outflow is less than the inflow, the reservoir, which represents the kingdom's wealth, remains stable and there is 'no ruin' ('Kedillai').

('Etrendru Iranguva'). The Kural's first advice is 'never do such an act' ('Seyyarka'). A second part of the vision shows an alternative: if they *do* commit the act, it is 'better not to regret it afterward' ('Matranna Seyyaamai Nandru'), as the regret adds a second layer of suffering. The painting captures the wisdom of avoiding actions that will lead to future self-torment.\n- Lighting: The present moment of choice is clear.

His ability to be brilliant among the brilliant and simple among the simple is the mark of his supreme tact.\n- Lighting: In the wise council, the minister and his peers are engaged in a dazzling exchange of bright, white light.

First, when the person is about to do wrong, they 'speak so as to make you weep' ('Azhachcholli'), showing them the future sorrow of their actions. Second, when the person has done wrong, they 'rebuke them sternly' ('Idiththu'). This honest, corrective friendship is shown to be the one that should be 'sought out and secured' ('Aaindhu Kolal').

First, the work is shown to 'fail' ('Poipadum'). The project is collapsing into a useless heap. Second, and worse, the fool's own failed actions are shown to be forging a set of heavy, iron 'fetters' ('Punaipoonum') that are now clamping onto his own wrists and ankles.

This act of getting ready is so effective that the enemies' joyful celebration is shown to 'perish' (மாயும்). Their arrogant smiles fade, and their confident postures slump as they realize their opponent is far more formidable than they had imagined.

In every new land they enter, this brand immediately identifies them, and they are cast out. They can 'find no life' and 'cannot exist' ('Yaandum Ularaakaar') anywhere.\n- Lighting: The person is constantly followed by the dark shadow of the king's wrath.

On the right, the same person is shown 'offending a great sage' or holy man ('Periyaarp Pizhaiththozhukuvaar').\n- Surrounding scene: A forest fire and a holy place.\n- Symbolic details: The sage's offense is not met with a physical attack, but with a silent, powerful, spiritual curse. This curse is visualized as a beam of light from the sage's eyes that completely and utterly annihilates the offender's soul. There is 'no escape' ('Uyyaar') from this. The painting shows that the wrath of the truly great is a spiritual force far more absolute and inescapable than even a physical fire.\n- Lighting: The forest fire is a chaotic, but ultimately natural, red and orange light.

Their wrath is a silent, spiritual force. As they frown upon the king, his magnificent kingdom is shown to be turning to dust and illusion. His great army dissolves, his gold turns to sand, and his palace begins to fade like a mirage. The Kural's question 'What will they become?' ('Ennaam?') is answered visually: they become nothing. The spiritual displeasure of the great is enough to unravel the very fabric of the material world.\n- Lighting: The kingdom is initially bathed in a brilliant, golden light of prosperity.

The kingdom of the great dynasty is in the valley below.\n- Symbolic details: The moment the sage makes his resolution, the effect on the kingdom is catastrophic and total. The entire kingdom, along with the 'whole family' ('Kudiyodu'), is shown being uprooted from the 'earth' ('Nilaththu') and 'utterly destroyed' ('Maaivar'). The destruction is not a battle, but a fundamental erasure, as if the very ground has rejected them. The quiet will of the mountain-like sage is shown to be an irresistible force of nature.\n- Lighting: A deep, ancient, and immensely powerful light surrounds the sage on his mountain.

This power is so immense that it strikes Indra, the king of the gods, causing his crown to shatter, his vajra (thunderbolt weapon) to crack, and his celestial throne to 'break in the middle' ('Idaimurindhu'). The king of the gods himself is shown to be 'ruined' ('Kendum') by the power of a truly realised soul on Earth.\n- Lighting: Indra's realm is full of brilliant, celestial, golden light.

Because there is no one to ask, there is no opportunity for the virtue of giving. Without charity, the world has lost its heart.

It is a powerful reminder of the deep 'misery of their own poverty' ('Nirappidumbai'). This memory is the 'sufficient witness' ('Saalum Kari').

Because the Creator has allowed such a state to exist, he himself is shown to be cursed. His divine robes are turning to beggar's rags, a begging bowl is forced into his hand, and he is condemned to 'wander and perish' ('Paranthu Keduka') as a beggar himself. The painting is a fierce and passionate indictment of a universal order that allows for the indignity of begging.\n\nLighting: The world of the beggars is lit with a dim, sorrowful light.

The other path is to 'resolve the poverty by begging' ('Irandutheer Vaamennum'). This choice is described as the 'hardest' or 'cruelest' form of 'folly' ('Vanmaiyin Vanpaattathil'). This is visualized by the path of begging being a dark, shameful road that, instead of leading out of poverty, leads into an even deeper and more terrible pit of dependency and self-contempt.

However, she has forgotten to 'remove the stems' ('Kaalkalaiyaal').\n- **Surrounding scene:** A festive place where drums should be beaten.\n- **Symbolic details:** The weight of the flower stems, which are normally considered weightless, is too much for her impossibly 'slender waist' ('Nukappirku'). The painting shows her delicate waist beginning to 'break' under this minuscule weight.

She is shown with her mouth sealed, unable to speak of her suffering because it is a result of her own past consent.\n\nLighting: The past memory is lit with a light of reluctant agreement.

However, the beloved's heart is depicted as a cold, stone wall. The beautiful river of her love simply strikes the wall and falls uselessly to the ground, unable to enter or have any effect. The Kural's question, 'What can they do for me?' ('Namakkevan Seypavo?'), is answered visually: nothing. Her love, without reciprocation, is a powerless and wasted force.\n\nLighting: A warm, powerful, but ultimately tragic, golden light flows from the maiden's heart.

This is like a porter trying to carry a heavy load on only one end of the pole. The pole is unbalanced, the weight is crushing, and the journey is 'painful' ('Innaathu'). On the right, 'love on both sides' ('Iruthalai Yaanum') is shown. Here, the weight of love is perfectly balanced on both ends of the pole.

Instead, he is simply 'thinking' ('ullinum') of his beloved.\n\nSurrounding scene: A solitary, perhaps melancholic, setting.\n\nSymbolic details: The Kural's comparison is made visual. The wine offers a certain pleasure, represented by a small, pleasant glow. However, the mere thought of his beloved is shown to create a far greater, 'unceasing, great joy' ('theeraap perumakizh'). This is visualized as an immense, brilliant, golden sun of happiness that erupts within his mind, completely dwarfing the small glow from the wine.

The almost-sneeze is a sign that her lover is 'about to think of her' ('ninaippavar pondru'). However, the sneeze then 'fails' to materialize ('kedum'), and this is a sign that he has, at the last moment, 'not thought of her' ('ninaiyaarkol').

The painting reveals that this painful act of parting actually 'contains a medicine' ('marunthonru udaiththu') that 'cures his sorrow'. As she leaves, she gives him a final, secret, meaningful glance. This glance is visualized as a single, glowing, magical pill of medicine that flies to the lover and heals his heart, giving him the strength to endure the separation.\n\nLighting: The departure is sad and shadowy.

Even in the midst of this joyful embrace, her mind is able to simultaneously 'bear her past sorrow' ('aridhaatri') and is already 'considering the possibility of his future faithlessness' ('anpinmai soozhvathudaiththu'). This is visualized as her body enjoying the warm, golden embrace, while her mind is a separate, cooler, more analytical space where she is reviewing her past pains and future fears.\n\nLighting: The embrace is a warm, brilliant, golden light.

He has only made the decision in his heart.\n\nSurrounding scene: A place by the sea.\n\nSymbolic details: The maiden's 'bracelets' ('valai') are shown to be supernaturally sensitive. They have 'understood his departure' ('thananthamai unarndha') even 'before she has' ('namminum munnam'). This is visualized as the bracelets suddenly becoming loose on her arm, not because she has grown thin, but because they have magically sensed his inner, secret decision to leave. Her very ornaments are more attuned to his heart than she is.\n\nLighting: A cold, decisive, blue light of separation is shown forming in the distant lover's heart.

This power is her ability to use her 'eyes' ('kanninaal') to do two things at once. First, her eyes are 'telling the story of her love-sickness' ('kaamanoi solli'). This is a look of sad longing.

A mere memory brings him a great, warm glow of happiness. Second, he is shown 'rejoicing at the mere sight' of her ('kaana makizhdhalum'). Her appearance brings an even greater joy. The Kural's point is that wine 'does not have' ('il') this dual power. The wine is shown to only bring pleasure when it is consumed, not when it is thought of or looked at. Love is shown to be a more potent and versatile source of joy.\n\nLighting: A warm, golden light of joy is generated by the lover's thoughts.

It is an overwhelming force.\n\nSurrounding scene: An intimate, romantic setting.\n\nSymbolic details: Because her desire is so immense, the painting shows that she has 'no desire for even a millet-seed's worth of a lover's quarrel' ('thinaiththunaiyum oodaamai vendum'). The option to feign dislike is shown as a tiny, insignificant millet seed, while her desire is a huge, magnificent palmyra fruit. The sheer scale of her passion has completely overwhelmed any inclination for the playful games of coyness or feigned anger.\n\nLighting: Her desire is a huge, brilliant, and overwhelmingly powerful golden light, like a sun.

The Kural implies a deep contradiction. The eyes are looking, but not truly seeing. This is visualized as her eyes projecting a beautiful image for him to see, but their own inner state is one of restless hunger.

Her angry thoughts are visualized. She is obsessing over the word 'anyone else', repeatedly asking 'More than who? More than who?' ('yaarinum? yaarinum?'). His attempt to praise her by comparison has backfired, as her jealous mind now wants a complete list of all the other women he is comparing her to. The painting captures the witty and paradoxical nature of a jealous lover's logic.\n\nLighting: The lover's words are a warm, golden light of intended praise.

The painting visualizes her interpretation. By specifying 'this life', he has implied that he might leave her in the next one. A sorrowful vision of her being alone in a future life appears in her tear-filled eyes. His attempt to reassure her for the present has inadvertently created a new fear for the future, showing the extreme sensitivity of a lover's heart.\n\nLighting: The lover's words are a warm, reassuring light for the present moment.

A jealous thought bubble appears above her head, containing the accusation, 'Who were you thinking of that made you sneeze?' ('yaarullith thummineer?').

This quarrel is not a destructive act. It is visualized as a small, sharp, but necessary pruning of the wilted parts of the plant. After this small, corrective pain, the plant of their love is shown to 'flourish again' and 'gain in glory' ('paadu perum'), bursting forth with new, more vibrant blossoms.
