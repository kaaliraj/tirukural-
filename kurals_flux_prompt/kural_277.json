      "Foreground": "A split, magnified view of a Kunri seed (Abrus precatorius berry). The main body of the seed is a beautiful, brilliant, flawless red.",
      "Midground": "The very tip of the seed, however, is a stark, absolute, and ugly black.",
      "Background": "This seed is used as a direct simile for a hypocrite. A person is shown whose outward appearance ('புறம்') is as beautiful and virtuous as the red part of the seed. However, a transparent view of their inner self ('அகம்') reveals that their heart is as black and corrupt as the tip of the seed ('மூக்கின் கரியார்')."

      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Deceptive, two-faced, beautiful but corrupt.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The lighting should emphasize the beautiful, glossy red of the seed and the person's exterior, and the deep, matte, light-absorbing black of the tip and the person's interior.",

        "Camera": "A macro shot that transitions from the beautiful red seed to its black tip, and then dissolves to show the person who embodies this same duality.",
