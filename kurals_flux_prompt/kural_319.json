      "Midground": "On the left, in the morning ('முற்பகல்'), a person is shown inflicting harm or sorrow ('இன்னா') upon another. This act sends a dark, boomerang-like shadow into the sky.",
      "Background": "On the right, in the evening of the same day ('பிற்பகல்'), the person is shown trying to relax. The dark shadow-boomerang they launched in the morning is now seen returning on its own ('தாமே வரும்') and striking them, causing them to suffer the same sorrow they inflicted."
