      "Midground": "On the left, a person is in the grip of excessive anger. They are shown as a walking corpse or a zombie ('இறந்தார் அனையர்'), their body grey and decaying, their eyes lifeless. Their anger has killed their spirit.",
      "Background": "On the right, a person has completely renounced anger ('சினத்தைத் துறந்தார்'). They are shown to be the equal of a great ascetic who has renounced the world and conquered death ('துறந்தார் துணை'). Both the man free from anger and the ascetic are depicted as radiant, immortal beings, glowing with a divine light."
