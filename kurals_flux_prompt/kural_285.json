      "Midground": "The deceitful person's heart is visualized as a barren, rocky wasteland, completely devoid of two specific, beautiful plants.",
      "Background": "In a contrasting vision of a virtuous heart, the two missing plants are shown flourishing: one is a radiant flower representing Grace/Compassion ('அருள்'), and the other is a strong tree representing Love ('அன்பு'). The fraudulent mind is shown to be inherently incapable of cultivating these qualities."
