      "Foreground": "An ascetic who has gained the ultimate power from their penance ('நோற்றலின் ஆற்றல் தலைப்பட்டவர்') stands before a great chasm.",
      "Midground": "On the other side of the chasm stands the God of Death, Yama ('கூற்றம்'). He has drawn a final, absolute line in the ground, representing the boundary of mortal life.",
      "Background": "The ascetic, empowered by their penance, is shown effortlessly and gracefully leaping over this line ('குதித்தலும் கைகூடும்'), transcending the power of death itself. Yama is shown looking on in shock and awe, his authority completely bypassed."
