      "Foreground": "A split composition. On the left, a person is shown caught in a raging forest fire ('எரியால் சுடப்படினும்'). It is a terrible situation, but a small, clear path of escape is visible, showing that survival is possible ('உய்வுண்டாம்').",
      "Midground": "On the right, another person is shown having committed an offense against a great, wise, and powerful sage ('பெரியார்ப் பிழைத்தொழுகுவார்').",
      "Background": "The sage is not attacking them. However, the consequence of their offense is shown to be a metaphysical one: the very path of life before the offender has completely vanished into a black, inescapable void. There is no possibility of survival ('உய்யார்'). The offense has erased their future."
