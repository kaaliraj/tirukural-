      "Foreground": "A farmer is working extremely hard in a barren field, their body showing great exertion ('மெய் வருத்த').",
      "Midground": "The divine or fated outcome is shown to be unfavorable. A divine hand ('தெய்வத்தான்') is shown blocking the sun, preventing the crops from growing. The goal is not achieved ('ஆகாது').",
      "Background": "However, the farmer's pure effort ('முயற்சி') does not go unrewarded. From the sweat of their brow, small, pure, glowing pearls or grains of silver ('கூலி') are shown manifesting and falling to the ground. Their effort itself has produced its own reward, independent of the fated outcome."

      "Subject_and_Action": "Even if fate prevents the ultimate success of an undertaking, the sheer effort and physical labor involved will pay its own wages and produce some reward.",

      "Lighting_and_Color": "The overall scene is somewhat dim due to the blocked sun. However, the farmer and the ground around them are illuminated by the warm, silver-gold light of the manifesting pearls of effort. This creates a pocket of light and hope in a fatedly difficult situation.",
