      "Foreground": "A person is shown having absorbed a vast amount of knowledge, represented by countless books and scrolls merging into their being ('பல்லவை கற்றும்'). Their mind is a brilliant, overflowing library.",
      "Midground": "However, when they stand before a good and wise assembly ('நல்லவையுள்'), they are unable to speak effectively. Their mouth is sealed, and the brilliant knowledge within them has no way to come out and benefit others ('நன்கு செலச்சொல்லாதார்').",
      "Background": "Because their knowledge remains trapped and useless, they are depicted as a barren tree, laden with beautiful, ripe fruit that no one can reach. They are ultimately without benefit ('பயமிலர்')."
