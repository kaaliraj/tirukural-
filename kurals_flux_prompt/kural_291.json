      "Midground": "This stream of light flows out into the world and interacts with various beings—a person, an animal, a plant. The light touches them gently and causes no harm whatsoever; in fact, it seems to bless them.",
      "Background": "For contrast, a dark, thorny word representing a harmful lie ('தீமை') is shown off to the side, withering a flower upon contact. This highlights the defining quality of the truthful words: their complete lack of any harmful quality ('தீமை இலாத'). This harmlessness is defined as 'Veracity' ('வாய்மை')."
