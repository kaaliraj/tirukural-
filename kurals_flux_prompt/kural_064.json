      "Foreground": "A close-up on a simple earthen bowl of rice porridge ('கூழ்'). A small child's hand ('சிறுகை') is playfully stirring it, making it wonderfully messy.",
      "Midground": "A parent is shown eating from this bowl. Their face is not just happy, but is depicted in a state of divine, transcendent bliss, as if tasting the sweetest thing in the universe.",
      "Background": "In the celestial realm, faintly visible, a god is drinking from a golden chalice of ambrosia ('அமிழ்து'), but their expression of pleasure is visibly less intense than the parent's."
