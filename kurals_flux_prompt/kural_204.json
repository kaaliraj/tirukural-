      "Foreground": "A person ('சூழ்ந்தவன்') is shown secretly plotting the ruin of another ('பிறன் கேடு சூழற்க'). Their malicious thoughts are visualized as a dark, thorny vine growing from their mind.",
      "Midground": "Unseen by the plotter, a powerful, radiant, and divine figure representing Virtue/Dharma ('அறம்') stands behind them. This figure is looking not at the intended victim, but at the plotter himself.",
      "Background": "The divine figure of Aram points a finger at the plotter, and the dark, thorny vine of malice instantly reverses its direction, turning back to ensnare and destroy its own creator ('அறம் சூழும் சூழ்ந்தவன் கேடு')."

      "Subject_and_Action": "If a person plots the ruin of another, the very principle of cosmic justice (Aram) will in turn plot the ruin of the plotter.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The thought-vine is a clear metaphor for the plot. The personification of Aram as a divine, judicial being makes the concept of cosmic justice tangible. The reversal of the vine is a direct, visual representation of karmic retribution.",
