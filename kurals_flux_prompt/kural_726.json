    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A split composition showing two parallel futilities. On the left, a timid, trembling coward is trying to hold a magnificent, heavy sword ('வாள்'), but is clearly terrified of it.",
      "Midground": "On the right, a scholar who is terrified of intelligent debate ('நுண்ணவை அஞ்சுபவர்') is holding a profound book of knowledge ('நூல்'), but is cowering and hiding behind it, afraid to speak.",
      "Background": "Both the sword and the book are shown to be powerful tools, but they are completely useless in the hands of those who lack the necessary courage—physical courage for the sword, and intellectual courage for the book."
