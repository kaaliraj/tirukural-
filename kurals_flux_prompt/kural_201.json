    "Tamil_Text": "தீவினையார் அஞ்சார் விழுமியார் அஞ்சுவர்தீவினை என்னும் செருக்கு.",
    "English_Meaning": "Those who have experience of evil deeds will not fear, but the excellent will fear the wanton pride of cherished sin."

    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A split composition. On the left, an 'evil-doer' ('தீவினையார்') walks arrogantly towards a cliff edge, laughing and completely unafraid ('அஞ்சார்').",
      "Midground": "On the right, an 'excellent' or 'virtuous' person ('விழுமியார்') stands far back from the same cliff edge, looking at it with profound dread and caution ('அஞ்சுவர்').",
      "Background": "The cliff edge represents the 'wanton pride of sin' ('தீவினை என்னும் செருக்கு'). Beyond the edge is a terrifying, dark abyss of karmic consequence. The evil-doer is oblivious to it, while the virtuous person clearly sees and fears it."

    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "A stark contrast in perception: the wicked do not fear sin because they are blind to its consequences, while the virtuous fear it precisely because they understand the terrible ruin it leads to.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The cliff is a metaphor for the point of no return in committing evil. The virtuous person's fear is not cowardice but wisdom, born of foresight. The evil-doer's fearlessness is not bravery but ignorant arrogance.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Cautionary, dread, wisdom vs. arrogance, impending doom.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The evil-doer's side is lit with a harsh, unnatural light that highlights their arrogance but blinds them to the abyss. The virtuous person's side is in a clear, natural light, allowing them to see the danger ahead. The abyss is pure, terrifying darkness.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "A wide, dramatic shot that captures both figures, their contrasting reactions, and the vast, dangerous cliff.",
        "Resolution": "8K, ultra-realistic, with strong emphasis on the contrasting body language of the two figures.",
        "Lighting": "Symbolic lighting to represent knowledge versus ignorance of consequences.",
        "Art_Genre": "Allegorical landscape, moralistic painting."
