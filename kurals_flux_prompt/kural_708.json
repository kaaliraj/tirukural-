      "Midground": "The minister is so perceptive that by simply looking at the king's face, they can see into his mind ('அகம்நோக்கி') and understand the problem that troubles him ('உற்றது உணர்வார்'). This is visualized as the minister seeing a ghostly image of the king's trouble (e.g., a foreign threat, a famine) floating between them.",
      "Background": "Because this perfect, unspoken communication is enough, the minister is shown already taking action to solve the problem. The simple act of looking at each other is sufficient for governance ('அமையும்')."
