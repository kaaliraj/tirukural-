      "Foreground": "A split, vertical composition. On the top half, a figure is engaged in strenuous, upward effort ('முயற்சி'). This is visualized as them determinedly climbing a steep, golden staircase that leads up into a realm of divine prosperity, presided over by the Goddess Lakshmi ('திரு').",
      "Midground": "On the bottom half, the same figure is shown without effort ('முயற்றின்மை'). They are idle and still. As a result, the ground beneath them cracks and opens, and they are being pulled down into a dark, barren abyss of absolute poverty and nothingness ('இன்மை').",
      "Background": "The background reflects the two destinies: the top is a bright, prosperous, celestial realm. The bottom is a dark, empty void."
