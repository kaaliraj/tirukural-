      "Midground": "However, a surreal effect reveals their true nature. The person on the right, who can understand things without being told ('கூறாமைக் கொள்வார்'), has a mind that is a brilliant, radiant, complex crystal. The person on the left, who lacks this skill, has a mind that is a simple, dull, solid rock.",
