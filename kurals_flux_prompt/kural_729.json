    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A symbolic ranking is shown. At the very bottom, in the lowest position, stands a scholar who is filled with knowledge (glowing mind) but is cowering in fear before a wise assembly ('கற்றறிந்தும் நல்லாரவை அஞ்சுவார்').",
      "Midground": "On a step above this fearful scholar stands an unlearned person ('கல்லாதவர்'). The unlearned person is not as bright, but they are not cowering in fear, giving them a slightly higher, though still low, status.",
      "Background": "The assembly of the good ('நல்லாரவை') is depicted as a source of bright, intellectual light, which the fearful scholar is unable to face, thus proving their inferior status."

    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "Those who have learned but fear to speak in a good assembly are considered even lower and more base than the unlearned.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The literal ranking on a set of steps, with the fearful scholar at the very bottom, is the central visual. This inversion of the expected hierarchy (learned above unlearned) makes the Kural's point powerfully.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Shameful, cowardly, ironic, a judgment of worth.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The assembly is the source of a bright, intimidating light. The fearful scholar is shown in a state of pathetic shadow, despite their inner knowledge.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "A wide shot that clearly shows the hierarchical positions of the two figures in relation to the assembly.",
        "Resolution": "8K, with strong, symbolic composition.",
