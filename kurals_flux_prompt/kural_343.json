      "Foreground": "An ascetic is shown in a moment of supreme renunciation. They are performing two simultaneous acts.",
      "Midground": "With one act, they are conquering their five senses ('அடல் வேண்டும் ஐந்தன் புலத்தை'). This is visualized as the five senses (sight, sound, etc.) being drawn inward and absorbed into a central point of stillness within them.",
      "Background": "Simultaneously ('ஒருங்கு'), they are letting go of all their past desires ('வேண்டிய எல்லாம்'). This is visualized as a vast collection of all worldly objects and pleasures turning to dust and blowing away ('விடல் வேண்டும்'). The two acts happen at the exact same moment."
