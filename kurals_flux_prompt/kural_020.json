    "Tamil_Text": "நீர்இன்று அமையாது உலகெனின் யார்யார்க்கும்வான்இன்று அமையாது ஒழுக்கு.",
    "English_Meaning": "If it be said that the duties of life cannot be discharged by any person without water, so without rain there cannot be the flowing of water."

    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "In the foreground, a dry, cracking riverbed, symbolizing the absence of water ('நீர்இன்று').",
      "Midground": "Along the banks of this dry river, various aspects of an orderly society ('ஒழுக்கு') are shown in a state of decay: fields are barren, trade has stopped, rituals are abandoned. The entire structure of life is crumbling.",
      "Background": "The ultimate source of this chaos is a vast, rainless sky ('வான்இன்று'). This sky is not empty, but filled with static, unmoving clouds that refuse to release their water, showing that the potential for order exists but is not being actualized."

      "Subject_and_Action": "A visual syllogism: Just as the world cannot function without water, the very principle of orderly conduct (virtue, duty, 'Ozhukku') cannot exist without rain from the heavens.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The flow of the river is a direct metaphor for the flow of an orderly, virtuous life. Its dryness signifies the breakdown of 'Ozhukku'. The world is depicted as a complex, interconnected machine that has ground to a halt because its primary power source—rain—has been cut off.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Systemic collapse, foundational breakdown, causality, logical finality.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "A stark, desaturated color palette. The light is flat and grey, as if all vibrancy has been drained from the world. The scene is depicted with a sense of grim, logical consequence rather than high drama.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "High-angle, epic wide shot, looking down upon the landscape to show the full extent of the societal breakdown along the dry river.",
        "Resolution": "8K, hyper-realistic, capturing the intricate details of a decaying civilization.",
        "Lighting": "Flat, overcast lighting with no distinct shadows, giving a sense of oppressive stillness and gloom.",
