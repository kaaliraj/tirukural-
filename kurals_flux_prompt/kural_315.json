      "Foreground": "A scholar is shown, surrounded by a vast library representing his great knowledge ('அறிவினான்').",
      "Midground": "He is witnessing another person's suffering ('பிறிதின் நோய்'). However, he does not treat this suffering with the same care and urgency as he would his own ('தன் நோய் போல் போற்றாக்கடை'). He remains detached and inactive.",
      "Background": "Because of his lack of empathy, his vast knowledge is shown to be useless. The books in his library turn to blank pages, and the light of his wisdom fades to nothing. The image poses the rhetorical question, 'What is the use of his knowledge?' ('ஆகுவது உண்டோ?'), and the answer is clearly 'nothing'."
