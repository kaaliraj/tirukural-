      "Foreground": "A split composition. On the left, a gambler is shown losing everything at a game of dice. The more they lose ('இழத்தொறூஉம்'), the more crazed and intense their love for the game becomes ('காதலிக்கும் சூது').",
      "Midground": "On the right, a soul is shown attached to a body that is experiencing great suffering and hardship ('துன்பம் உழத்தொறூஉம்').",
