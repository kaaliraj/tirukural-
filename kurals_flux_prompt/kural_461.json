      "Foreground": "A wise king or leader is shown contemplating a major action, represented by a complex, glowing chess board in front of them.",
      "Midground": "Three distinct, ethereal visions appear above the board, born from the leader's process of consideration ('சூழ்ந்து'). The first vision shows the potential losses ('அழிவது')—crumbled forts, lost soldiers. The second shows the potential acquisitions ('ஆவது')—new territory, captured treasure. The third, and most prominent, vision shows the long-term net profit or resulting good ('வழிபயக்கும் ஊதியம்')—a peaceful, prosperous kingdom.",
      "Background": "The leader's hand is poised over a chess piece, ready to act ('செயல்'), but only after having fully weighed all three outcomes."

      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The chess board represents the strategic nature of the decision. The three distinct visions are a literal representation of the three factors to be weighed. The final vision of 'net profit' is shown to be the most important, guiding the final decision.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Deliberate, strategic, wise, calculating, foresighted.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "A clear, intellectual light illuminates the scene. The vision of loss is in dark, smoky colors. The vision of acquisition is in a bright, metallic gold. The final vision of net benefit is in a warm, stable, and enduring golden light.",
