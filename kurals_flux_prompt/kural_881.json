      "Foreground": "A split composition. On the left, a beautiful, shady oasis with a pool of cool water ('நிழல்நீரும்') is shown. However, the water is subtly poisonous, and a person drinking from it is shown becoming sick. What should be pleasant has become harmful ('இன்னாத').",
      "Midground": "On the right, a person is surrounded by their close family and relatives ('தமர்'). The family should be a source of comfort, but they are shown speaking cruel words and performing harmful actions ('இன்னா செயின்').",
      "Background": "The person surrounded by their harmful family is shown suffering in the same way as the person who drank the poison water. The nature of the kin has become unpleasant and harmful ('இன்னாவாம்')."
