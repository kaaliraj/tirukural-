    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A master spy is shown in a hostile environment, like an enemy court. Their appearance is completely unremarkable and raises no suspicion ('கடாஅ உருவொடு').",
      "Midground": "They are being stared at intensely by menacing guards, but their own eyes are fearless and show no hint of being intimidated ('கண்ணஞ்சாது'). A surreal effect shows magical attempts to read their mind, but their thoughts are a perfect, impenetrable blank slate, revealing nothing ('உகாஅமை').",
      "Background": "The spy is successfully gathering critical information, completely undetected, demonstrating their ultimate skill ('வல்லதே ஒற்று')."

      "Lighting_and_Color": "The lighting is naturalistic to fit the scene, but a subtle inner light in the spy's eyes can hint at their hidden strength. The mind-reading attempt can be a brief, failed magical effect.",
