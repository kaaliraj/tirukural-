    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "In the foreground, a multi-generational Tamil family—from elders to children—walks with serene and healthy expressions along a path of light.",
      "Midground": "The path they walk on is straight, radiant, and clearly defined. On either side of the path, the wilderness contains alluring but ghostly illusions representing the five senses—a shimmering mirage (sight), floating musical notes that lead to thorny bushes (sound), a beautifully colored but rotting fruit (smell/taste), and invitingly soft moss that hides sharp rocks (touch).",
      "Background": "In the deep background, the path originates from a colossal, abstract figure of a meditating sage, carved into a mountain. The figure has five waterfalls flowing from its senses (eyes, ears, etc.), which turn to mist before they can form a river, symbolizing the mastery over senses."

      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Steadfast serenity, enduring prosperity, disciplined peace.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The path and the family are illuminated by a clear, pure white-gold light. The surrounding temptations are cast in a chaotic mix of oversaturated and murky, deceptive colors that quickly fade to grey."
