      "Foreground": "A person has just been harmed by another ('இன்னா செய்தார்').",
      "Midground": "Instead of retaliating, the victim responds with an unexpected and overwhelming act of kindness ('நல் நயம் செய்து'). This act of kindness is visualized as a wave of warm, golden light.",
      "Background": "The original wrongdoer is engulfed by this light of kindness. The light does not harm them, but it causes their own malicious act to be reflected back at them in a mirror of shame. They are shown cowering, not from fear of punishment, but from the deep shame of their own actions when contrasted with the victim's nobility ('அவர் நாண'). This is the true 'punishment' ('ஒறுத்தல்')."

      "Subject_and_Action": "The greatest punishment for one who has harmed you is to shame them into realizing their own smallness by responding with an act of great and noble kindness.",

      "Lighting_and_Color": "The initial evil act is dark. The responding act of kindness is a brilliant, warm, golden light that completely transforms the scene, washing away the darkness and replacing it with the harsh light of self-realization for the wrongdoer.",
