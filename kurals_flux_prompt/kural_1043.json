      "Midground": "The slime is shown to have a dual destructive effect. It covers and dissolves a magnificent, ancient family tree behind the person, destroying their 'ancient lineage' ('தொல்வரவு').",
      "Background": "Simultaneously, the slime touches the person's mouth, and the eloquent, dignified words they were speaking ('தோல்,' here meaning the skin of the tongue, hence speech) are shown turning into meaningless, stammering gibberish. It destroys both their heritage and their personal dignity at once."
