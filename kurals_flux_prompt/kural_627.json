      "Background": "The person's inner self, their consciousness, is shown as a serene, untouched, glowing figure floating just inside the body. It observes the arrows hitting the body but remains completely calm and undisturbed ('கலக்கத்தைக் கையாறாக் கொள்ளாது'), understanding that the body is meant to be the target, not the self."
