      "Foreground": "A person is shown committing adultery, thinking it is an 'easy' and trivial matter ('எளிது என').",
      "Midground": "The moment he commits the act, a dark, spectral mark of blame ('பழி') appears on his soul. It is like a brand or a permanent, ugly tattoo.",
      "Background": "A time-lapse sequence shows the man moving through the rest of his life and even into future lives. While everything else about him changes and fades—his youth, his wealth, his very body—the dark mark of blame remains. It is eternal, imperishable, and never leaves him ('எஞ்ஞான்றும் விளியாது நிற்கும்')."
