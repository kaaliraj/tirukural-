      "Background": "Because of their clear vision, they do not see the meat as food. They see its true origin: they see the moment the life ('உயிர்') was violently separated from the body ('தலைப்பிரிந்த ஊன்'). A ghostly, tragic vision of the slaughtered animal appears over the plate. Due to this clear perception of the violence inherent in the meat, they refuse to eat it ('உண்ணார்')."
