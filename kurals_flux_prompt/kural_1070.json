    "English_Meaning": "Saying \"No\" to a beggar takes away his life. (but as that very word will kill the refuser) where then would the latter's life hide itself?."

      "Foreground": "A person who refuses to give ('கரப்பவர்') utters the word 'No'. As they speak, the life-force ('உயிர்') of the beggar ('இரப்பவர்') in front of them is shown being extinguished, like a candle flame being blown out ('போகும் உயிர்').",
      "Midground": "However, the uttered word 'No' becomes a deadly, spectral boomerang. It flies out, extinguishes the beggar's life, and then instantly flies back towards the speaker.",
      "Background": "The speaker is shown looking around in terror, wondering where their own soul can possibly hide ('யாங்கு ஒளிக்கும்'), as the deadly word they themselves created is now coming back to kill them. There is no escape."

      "Subject_and_Action": "The act of refusing a beggar is so potent that it kills the beggar's spirit, but that same act of refusal becomes a deadly karmic weapon that returns to destroy the refuser, leaving them with no place to hide.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The word 'No' as a spectral, boomerang-like weapon is the central metaphor. The extinguishing of the life-flames is a clear visual of the deadly effect on both parties. The refuser's panic and search for a hiding place that doesn't exist shows the inescapability of the consequence.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Karmic retribution, deadly, inescapable, terrifying.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The scene is dark and dramatic. The word 'No' is a weapon of pure darkness. The life-flames are small, fragile points of light that are easily extinguished. The overriding mood is one of inevitable doom for the refuser.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "A dynamic shot that follows the deadly trajectory of the word 'No' as it kills the beggar and returns to doom its creator.",
        "Resolution": "8K, ultra-realistic, with powerful ethereal effects for the life-flames and the weaponized word.",
        "Lighting": "High-contrast, dramatic lighting (chiaroscuro).",
        "Art_Genre": "Dark fantasy, horror."
