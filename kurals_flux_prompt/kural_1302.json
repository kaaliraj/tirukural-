    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A split composition illustrating a powerful simile.",
      "Midground": "On the left, a delicious, perfectly prepared meal is being served. A hand is adding just a small, perfect pinch of salt ('உப்பு அமைந்தற்று'), which is shown to elevate the dish to perfection. This represents a short, well-timed lover's pout ('புலவி').",
      "Background": "On the right, the same delicious meal is shown, but a hand is pouring an excessive amount of salt onto it, completely ruining it. This represents a pout that has been allowed to go on for too long ('நீள விடல்'). The food is visibly rendered inedible."

    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "Lover's pouting is like salt in a meal: a little bit enhances the flavor of love, but letting it go on for too long is like adding too much salt, which ruins everything.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The direct comparison of pouting to salt is the core of the image. The perfect pinch versus the excessive pour is a clear visual representation of the correct and incorrect duration of a lover's quarrel.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Balanced, cautionary, proportional.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The well-salted dish on the left looks delicious, bathed in a warm, appetizing light. The over-salted dish on the right looks disgusting, with a harsh, unappealing light highlighting the ruinous excess of white salt.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "A clean, clear diptych shot, like a page from a high-end cookbook, that perfectly illustrates the 'recipe' for a successful pout.",
        "Resolution": "8K, hyper-realistic food photography style.",
        "Lighting": "Contrasting lighting to show 'appetizing' versus 'ruined'.",
