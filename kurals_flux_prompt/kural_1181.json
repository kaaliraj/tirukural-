      "Foreground": "A woman is shown. Her skin has a sickly, pale-yellow hue of lovesickness ('பசந்த என் பண்பு').",
      "Midground": "A ghostly flashback shows the moment of her lover's departure. In that memory, she is shown bravely and foolishly consenting to his leaving, believing she could bear it ('நல்காமை நேர்ந்தேன்').",
      "Background": "In the present, she is shown completely alone, with no one to confide in. The image poses the question, 'To whom can I speak of this?' ('யார்க்கு உரைக்கோ'). Her own past consent has trapped her in a silent, lonely suffering."

    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "A woman suffers from the pallor of lovesickness, but feels she has no right to complain to anyone, because she herself consented to her lover's departure.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The contrast between her brave face in the past and her suffering face in the present is key. Her isolation is a direct consequence of her past decision, creating a state of self-inflicted, silent misery.",

      "Lighting_and_Color": "The present scene is dominated by the sickly, pale yellow-green of 'pasappu' (the pallid hue). The flashback is lit with a falsely brave, perhaps slightly too-bright light. The overall atmosphere is melancholic and isolated.",

        "Camera": "A close-up on the woman's suffering face, with the ghostly flashback of her consent visible as a painful overlay.",
