      "Background": "On the right, a lover is suffering from the 'disease' of lovesickness ('தன் நோய்க்கு'). The cause of the disease—the beautiful, jeweled maiden ('அணி இழை')—is standing before him. In a paradoxical twist, she herself is also the only medicine ('தானே மருந்து'). She leans in to embrace him, and her touch instantly heals the pain she caused."
