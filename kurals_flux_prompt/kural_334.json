      "Foreground": "To the ignorant, a beautiful, welcoming gateway labeled 'A New Day' ('நாள் என ஒன்று போல் காட்டி') is shown, with people happily walking through it.",
      "Midground": "From the perspective of the wise ('உணர்வார்ப் பெறின்'), the true nature of the gateway is revealed. It is not a gate, but the sharp, serrated blade of a colossal, cosmic saw ('வாள்').",
      "Background": "Each person who walks through the 'gateway' is actually taking a step along the saw's blade, which is relentlessly cutting through the great tree of their lifespan ('உயிர் ஈரும்'). Their life is visibly shortened with each 'day' they pass."

      "Lighting_and_Color": "The 'gateway' view is bright, cheerful, and deceptive. The 'saw' view is stark, metallic, and menacing. The lighting should shift dramatically to reveal the terrifying reality.",
