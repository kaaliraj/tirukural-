      "Foreground": "A stark, split-screen composition showing two parallel scenes of exclusion.",
      "Midground": "On the left side ('இவ்வுலகம்'), a destitute person without money ('பொருளில்லார்') is shown being barred from entering a prosperous, vibrant city. The material world rejects them. On the right side ('அவ்வுலகம்'), the soul of a cruel, merciless person ('அருளிலார்') is shown arriving at the gates of a beautiful, celestial afterlife. These gates are also firmly shut, barring their entry.",
      "Background": "The visual structure creates a direct and powerful analogy: lack of wealth leads to exclusion from this world, and lack of mercy leads to exclusion from the next."
