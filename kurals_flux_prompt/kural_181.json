    "Chapter": "புறங்கூறாமை (Not Backbiting)",
    "Tamil_Text": "அறங்கூறான் அல்ல செயினும் ஒருவன்புறங்கூறான் என்றல் இனிது.",
    "English_Meaning": "Though one do not even speak of virtue and live in sin, it will be well if it be said of him \"he does not backbite\"."

  "Flux_Optimized_Prompt": {
    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A man is depicted who is clearly not virtuous in other ways. He is shown turning his back on a glowing symbol of Virtue ('அறம் கூறான்') and walking a shadowy path of unrighteous deeds ('அல்ல செயினும்').",
      "Midground": "However, he possesses one redeeming quality. When given the opportunity to backbite—visualized as a shadowy serpent of slander whispering in his ear—he firmly refuses, shaking his head no ('புறங்கூறான்').",
      "Background": "Because of this one single, powerful virtue, a single, gentle beam of pure, sweet light ('இனிது') shines down from the heavens and touches him, even on his dark path. It is a small but significant mark of goodness in an otherwise flawed character."
    },
    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "Even if a man is otherwise completely sinful, the single virtue of not backbiting is in itself a sweet and good thing that brings a touch of grace to his life.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The single beam of sweet light is the key. It doesn't erase his other sins or change his dark path, but it shows that this one virtue has a standalone, positive value. The serpent of slander represents the temptation he is resisting.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Redeeming, hopeful, singularly virtuous.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The man's path is dark and shadowy. The light of virtue is far from him. But the sweet, gentle light of 'not backbiting' is a warm, small, but distinct beam that gives him a moment of grace.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "A shot that captures the man on his dark path, his refusal of the serpent of slander, and the single beam of light that blesses him for it.",
        "Resolution": "8K, ultra-realistic, with a focus on the man's complex, flawed-but-principled-in-one-thing expression.",
        "Lighting": "High-contrast, with a single, redeeming beam of light in an otherwise dark scene.",
        "Art_Genre": "Symbolic realism, with a touch of the divine."
