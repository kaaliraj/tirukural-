      "Midground": "In response to this act, the entire Earth ('வையகம்') below them and the Heavens ('வானகம்') above them are shown trying to offer their greatest treasures in return. The Earth offers up gold and gems; the Heavens offer celestial crowns and glories.",
      "Background": "A vast cosmic scale appears. On one side is the simple, unsolicited act of help. On the other side are all the treasures of Heaven and Earth. The scale tips heavily on the side of the simple act of help, showing that even the combined cosmos cannot repay its worth."
