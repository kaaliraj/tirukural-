      "Foreground": "A young man is suffering from a poverty that is not associated with virtue ('அறம் சாரா நல்குரவு'). He is destitute and perhaps looks slightly disreputable.",
      "Midground": "He approaches his own mother ('ஈன்ற தாய்') for help and comfort.",
      "Background": "His mother looks at him not with the warmth and love of a parent, but with the cold, distant, and mistrustful gaze of a stranger ('பிறன் போல நோக்கப்படும்'). His dishonorable poverty has broken the most fundamental human bond."

      "Subject_and_Action": "A person afflicted by a non-virtuous poverty will be looked upon as a stranger even by the very mother who gave birth to them.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The mother's cold, estranged gaze is the central and most heartbreaking element of the image. The distinction that this is a 'non-virtuous' poverty is important; it is not noble suffering, but the poverty that comes from vice, which is what severs the bond.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Heartbreaking, alienated, estranged, tragic.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "A cold, grey, unforgiving light. The mother and son are separated by an invisible wall of emotional distance. The palette is desaturated to emphasize the lack of familial warmth.",

        "Camera": "An intimate but cold two-shot, focusing on the lack of connection between the two faces. The emotional distance should be palpable.",
