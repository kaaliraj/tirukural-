      "Background": "On the right, a hypocrite is shown. First, they are seen stabbing a friend in the back ('புறன் அழிஇ'). Then, they turn around and meet that same friend with a false, deceitful smile ('பொய்த்து நகை'). This act is depicted as generating a far more intense, concentrated, and horrifying darkness than all the other sins on the left. It is 'the greater evil' ('தீதே')."
