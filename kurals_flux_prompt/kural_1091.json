      "Foreground": "A close-up on a maiden's beautiful, kohl-lined eyes ('உண்கண்').",
      "Midground": "Her gaze has a dual, paradoxical quality ('இரு நோக்கு'). One of her eyes shoots a tiny, sharp, painful dart of lovesickness ('நோய் நோக்கு') at the viewer/lover. The other eye simultaneously sends out a gentle, healing, golden beam of light that is the 'remedy' for that very pain ('அந்நோய் மருந்து').",
      "Background": "The lover is shown caught between these two opposing forces—simultaneously wounded and healed by the same glance, trapping them in a state of beautiful, exquisite torment and bliss."
