    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A surreal diptych. On the left panel, a beautiful musical instrument, like a harp or veena, is being played, but it produces a harsh, discordant noise (visualized as jagged, chaotic soundwaves) because it is out of tune with the song ('பண்என்னாம்').",
      "Midground": "On the right panel, a pair of physically perfect, beautiful human eyes are shown. However, they are cold, hard, and stone-like, completely lacking any warmth or kindness ('கண்ணோட்டம் இல்லாத கண்'). They are useless.",
      "Background": "Both scenes are presented as equally useless and meaningless, demonstrating the parallel failure. The listeners on the left are covering their ears; the people being looked at on the right are shivering from the cold gaze."

    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "A direct analogy: an eye without kindness is as useless as music without harmony.",

      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Useless, disharmonious, cold, meaningless.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The left panel has harsh, chaotic colors to match the sound. The right panel is lit with a cold, sterile, blue-white light that emphasizes the lack of warmth.",

        "Camera": "A clean, side-by-side composition that makes the comparison immediate and clear.",
        "Resolution": "8K, with abstract effects for the sound and detailed textures for the stone eyes.",
