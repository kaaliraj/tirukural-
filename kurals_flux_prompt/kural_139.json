      "Foreground": "A person of great decorum ('ஒழுக்கம் உடையவர்') is shown. Their mind and character are visualized as a pure, well-guarded spring of water.",
      "Midground": "The person is shown in a moment of carelessness or forgetfulness ('வழுக்கியும்'), perhaps stumbling or being caught off guard.",
      "Background": "Even in this unguarded moment, the words that come from their mouth ('வாயாற் சொலல்') are still pure and good. The water that splashes out from the spring is still clean. It is shown to be impossible ('ஒல்லாவே') for evil words ('தீய'), represented by muddy water, to emerge from such a pure source, no matter the circumstance."
