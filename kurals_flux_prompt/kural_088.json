      "Foreground": "An old, wealthy man sits alone in a vast, locked treasure room, filled with gold and jewels that he has painstakingly guarded ('பரிந்து ஓம்பி').",
      "Midground": "His expression is one of deep regret and desolation. He is clutching his treasures, but his body language shows that he is utterly alone and without support ('பற்றற்றேம்').",
      "Background": "Through a barred window, we see a vision of what he missed: a world of joyful connection, with guests being welcomed at other homes. His own path is a dead end, a life of fruitless accumulation."

      "Lighting_and_Color": "The treasure room is dark and shadowy, lit only by the cold, metallic gleam of the gold. This contrasts with the warm, inviting light of the world of hospitality visible outside the window. The palette is dominated by darks and cold metallic colors.",

        "Camera": "A somber, close-up shot on the old man's face to capture his profound regret. The vast, sterile wealth surrounds him.",
