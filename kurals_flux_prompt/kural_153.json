    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A split composition. On the left, a scene of extreme poverty ('இன்மையுள் இன்மை'): a wealthy man turns away a guest, and as he does, his own riches turn to dust, revealing his true destitution.",
      "Midground": "On the right, a scene of extreme strength ('வன்மையுள் வன்மை'): a powerful, wise sage is surrounded by foolish, ignorant people ('மடவார்') who are mocking and distracting them. The sage remains in perfect, unshakable meditative peace ('பொறை'), their inner strength forming a visible shield of tranquility.",
      "Background": "The background for the left is a desolate, barren landscape. The background for the right is a majestic, stable mountain range, reflecting the sage's inner fortitude."

      "Subject_and_Action": "A visual contrast of the ultimate extremes: the worst poverty is the inability to be hospitable, and the greatest strength is the ability to patiently endure the ignorant.",

      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Stark contrast, pathetic vs. powerful, true poverty vs. true strength.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The left side is dark, desaturated, and crumbling. The right side is illuminated by the sage's inner light, which is calm, steady, and brilliant white-gold. The palette contrasts decay with stability.",
