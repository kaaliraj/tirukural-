    "Chapter": "தீவினையச்சம் (Dread of Evil Deeds)",
    "Tamil_Text": "தீயவை தீய பயத்தலால் தீயவைதீயினும் அஞ்சப் படும்.",
    "English_Meaning": "Because evil produces evil, therefore should evil be feared more than fire."

  "Flux_Optimized_Prompt": {
    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A person is shown dropping a single, dark seed representing an evil act ('தீயவை') onto the ground.",
      "Midground": "From this single seed, a monstrous, thorny, and poisonous vine instantly grows, multiplies, and spreads, representing evil producing more evil ('தீய பயத்தலால்'). This vine is more terrifying and entrapping than a simple fire.",
      "Background": "In the background, for comparison, a fire ('தீ') is burning. While dangerous, it is contained and its threat seems less insidious than the rapidly spreading, self-replicating evil vine. A figure is shown recoiling in greater fear from the evil vine than from the fire."
    },
    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "Evil deeds should be feared more than fire, because unlike fire which just consumes, evil actively self-replicates and produces more evil.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The evil act as a seed that grows into a monstrous vine is a powerful metaphor for karmic multiplication. The fire is a baseline for fear, which the fear of evil is shown to surpass.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Terrifying, cautionary, dread, self-propagating horror.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The evil vine is a sickly, dark purple and black, and it seems to absorb light. The fire, in contrast, produces a natural, orange light. The scene is dominated by the terrifying shadow of the growing evil.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "A dramatic wide shot that captures the initial act, the horrific growth, and the comparison with the fire.",
        "Resolution": "8K, hyper-realistic, with advanced procedural generation for the growing thorny vine.",
        "Lighting": "The fire provides one light source, but the growing evil creates an encroaching, supernatural darkness.",
        "Art_Genre": "Dark fantasy, horror, allegorical art."
