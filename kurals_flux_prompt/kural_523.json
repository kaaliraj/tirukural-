      "Foreground": "A person is shown standing alone, refusing to mingle with their relatives who are nearby ('அளவளா வில்லாதான்').",
      "Midground": "The person's wealth is visualized as a large body of water. However, because they are isolated, this body of water has no banks or retaining walls ('குளவளாக் கோடின்றி').",
      "Background": "As wealth (water) pours in from a spring, it is not retained. It immediately spills out in all directions and is wasted, soaking uselessly into the surrounding barren ground. The wealth brings no lasting benefit."
