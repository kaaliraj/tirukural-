      "Foreground": "A person is shown standing before a dark, ominous-looking door, which represents a regrettable action. Their hand is hovering, about to open it.",

      "Background": "The image also suggests the second part of the kural: if the act is already done, it is better to move on without the self-destructive grief. This can be shown by a separate small scene where the person, having gone through the door, resolutely walks away from it, not looking back ('செய்யாமை நன்று')."
