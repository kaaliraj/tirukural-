      "Foreground": "A person is shown feeling a spark of anger ('வெகுளி') towards another.",
      "Midground": "Instead of nurturing it, they are shown actively 'forgetting' or extinguishing it ('மறத்தல்'). The spark of anger is snuffed out.",
      "Background": "A horrific vision of the alternative is shown. If the spark of anger were not extinguished, it would give birth ('பிறத்தல்') to a monstrous, endless brood of all other evils ('தீய'). A single spark of anger is shown birthing a horde of demons representing strife, hatred, violence, and sorrow."
