      "Foreground": "A direct and powerful visual analogy. On the left, in a fierce battlefield ('பகையகத்து'), an effeminate or cowardly person ('பேடி') holds a sharp, shining sword ('ஒள்வாள்'), but is trembling and unable to use it effectively against an enemy.",
      "Midground": "On the right, in a learned assembly ('அவையகத்து'), a scholar who is terrified of the audience ('அஞ்சுமவன்') holds a great book of knowledge ('கற்ற நூல்'). Like the coward with the sword, he is trembling and unable to use his knowledge effectively.",
      "Background": "In both cases, the powerful tool—the sword and the book—is rendered completely useless and pathetic by the fear of the person holding it."

      "Subject_and_Action": "The knowledge of a scholar who fears the assembly is as useless as a sharp sword in the hands of a coward on the battlefield.",

      "Lighting_and_Color": "Harsh, judgmental lighting on both figures, highlighting their fear and failure. The sword and book can gleam ironically.",
