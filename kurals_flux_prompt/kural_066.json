      "Foreground": "A parent is sitting with an expression of absolute enchantment, listening to their small child's lisping, babbling words ('மழலைச்சொல்').",
      "Midground": "The child's simple words manifest as beautiful, glowing, musical notes that are far more vibrant and compelling than anything else in the scene.",
      "Background": "In the dimly lit background, two divine musicians—one playing a flute ('குழல்') and one a lute ('யாழ்')—are shown. The music from their instruments is depicted as fading, grey notes that dissolve before they can reach the parent, completely outshone by the child's voice."

      "Subject_and_Action": "The lisping words of one's own child are declared to be infinitely sweeter than the most divine music of the flute or the lute.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The visual competition between the sources of sound is key. The child's 'mazhalai' produces golden, living notes, while the divine instruments produce grey, lifeless ones. The musicians themselves might have expressions of surprise or resignation, acknowledging the superior sweetness.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Enchanting, sublime sweetness, adoration, innocent power.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The primary light source is the child and their glowing words, which casts a warm, magical light on the parent's face. The background musicians are in shadow, their divine status irrelevant in this context.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "Medium close-up on the parent and child, with a shallow depth of field that pushes the divine musicians into the insignificant background.",
        "Resolution": "8K, ultra-realistic, with a focus on the parent's captivated expression and magical effects for the musical notes.",
        "Lighting": "Symbolic chiaroscuro, contrasting the bright, loving foreground with the faded, unimportant background.",
        "Art_Genre": "Magical realism, sentimental portraiture."
