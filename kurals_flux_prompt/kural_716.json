    "English_Meaning": "To blunder in the presence of those who have acquired a vast store of learning and know (the value thereof) is like a good man stumbling (and falling away) from the path (of virtue)."

    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A scholar makes a mistake or a foolish statement ('இழுக்கு') in a council of deeply learned experts ('வியன்புலம் ஏற்று உணர்வார் முன்னர்').",
      "Midground": "In a powerful, parallel simile, a virtuous ascetic who has been walking a straight, narrow path of virtue ('ஆற்றின்') for many years is shown suddenly stumbling and falling ('நிலை தளர்ந்து') off that path into a dark ravine.",
      "Background": "The two events are framed as being of equal gravity and shame. The scholar's intellectual slip is given the same weight as a great sage's spiritual fall."

    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "To make an intellectual blunder before true experts is a disgrace as great as a virtuous man falling from his path of discipline.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The parallel fall is the central concept. The scholar's blunder can be visualized as them slipping on a smooth, polished floor. The ascetic's fall is from a high, narrow mountain path. The equivalence of these two falls is the main point.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Shameful, disgraceful, a great fall, cautionary.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "Both scenes are lit with a harsh, judgmental light that emphasizes the moment of failure. The scholar's environment is an intellectual one, the ascetic's is a spiritual one, but the moment of collapse is the same.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "A split-screen or diptych shot to force the comparison between the intellectual fall and the spiritual fall.",
        "Resolution": "8K, ultra-realistic, capturing the shock and shame on the faces of both the scholar and the ascetic.",
        "Lighting": "High-contrast, dramatic lighting to highlight the moment of failure.",
        "Art_Genre": "Allegorical painting, symbolic realism."
