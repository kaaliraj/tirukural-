      "Midground": "On the right, a wise, virtuous person who 'knows what is good' ('நன்று அறிவார்'). Their mind is depicted as a complex landscape of moral duties, concerns, and anxieties ('அவலம்'), and their expression is noble but burdened with care.",
      "Background": "On the left, a base person ('கயவர்') is shown living a life of careless indulgence. Their mind is a complete blank, an empty, peaceful void ('நெஞ்சத்து அவலம் இலர்'). Because of this freedom from conscience, their external life is one of carefree, blissful enjoyment ('திருவுடையர்')."

      "Lighting_and_Color": "The wise person's scene is in noble but somber and complex colors. The base person's scene is lit with a bright, simple, almost stupidly cheerful light. The palette contrasts complex, thoughtful tones with simple, hedonistic ones.",
