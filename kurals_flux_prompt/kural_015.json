      "Midground": "On the right side, the same scene transformed by the arrival of rain (restoration, 'எடுப்பது'): the same family now hopeful, new green shoots emerging, the river beginning to flow under gentle, rain-filled clouds.",
      "Background": "A central, powerful cloud formation that is dark and withholding on the left, but releasing life-giving rain on the right, acting as the agent of both ruin and restoration."
