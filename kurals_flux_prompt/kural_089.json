    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A man of great wealth ('உடைமையுள்') is shown turning away a needy guest from his door.",
      "Midground": "Although he is surrounded by riches, a dark, spectral aura of true Poverty ('இன்மை') is shown clinging to him, a direct result of his foolish inhospitality ('மடமை').",
      "Background": "His magnificent house appears illusory and hollow. The man himself has a dull, foolish expression ('மடவார்'), showing that his lack of hospitality is a form of profound ignorance."
    },
    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "The paradox of being poor while wealthy. The failure to practice hospitality is defined as a form of stupidity that creates a spiritual poverty, regardless of material possessions.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The spectral aura of Poverty is a key visual, showing that true 'Inmai' is a spiritual condition, not a material one. The man's wealth has no glow or warmth; it is just inert matter. His face shows ignorance, not malice.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Paradoxical, foolish, spiritual poverty, pathetic.",
