      "Foreground": "Two foolish friends ('பேதையார்') are shown having a wonderful, delightful time together ('பெரிதினிது'). They are laughing and enjoying their superficial connection.",
      "Midground": "The moment of their parting is shown. They simply turn their backs on each other and walk away with casual, emotionless expressions.",
      "Background": "There is no lingering sadness, no sorrow, no pain at their separation ('பீழை தருவதொன்று இல்'). Their bond was so shallow that breaking it causes no emotional damage, which, in a darkly ironic way, is a kind of 'pleasure'."

      "Subject_and_Action": "The friendship of fools is very sweet, because when it ends, there is no pain.",
