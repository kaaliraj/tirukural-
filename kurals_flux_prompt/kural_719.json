      "Midground": "The assembly of the ignorant is visualized as a barren field of stone and dust, incapable of bearing fruit.",
      "Background": "The orator is carrying precious, glowing seeds, representing their good and potent words. Even though they seem to forget themselves for a moment ('பொச்சாந்தும்'), they instinctively stop themselves from casting these precious seeds onto the barren ground, knowing it would be a complete waste. They hold their words back ('சொல்லற்க')."
