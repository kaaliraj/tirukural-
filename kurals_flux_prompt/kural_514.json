      "Foreground": "A person is shown having passed numerous difficult tests ('எனைவகையான் தேறிய'), and is being awarded a medal of honor. They appear virtuous and capable.",
      "Midground": "The same person is then placed in a new, challenging work environment—perhaps a chaotic battlefield or a complex construction site ('வினைவகையான்'). Under the pressure of the new task, their form begins to change and corrupt ('வேறாகும் மாந்தர்'), revealing a different, less capable, or more treacherous nature that was previously hidden.",
      "Background": "A gallery of other figures are shown in the background, each with a similar 'before' and 'after' transformation, emphasizing that this is a common human trait ('பலர்')."

      "Subject_and_Action": "Even after someone has been thoroughly tested, their true nature can change and be revealed differently when they are faced with the specific nature of a real-world task.",

      "Lighting_and_Color": "The 'testing' phase is lit with a clear, noble light. The 'working' phase is lit with a harsh, stressful light that causes the negative transformation. The colors shift from pure to corrupt.",
