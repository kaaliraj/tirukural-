      "Background": "A symbolic scale of pleasure is shown. On one side is a representation of the full physical union of love. On the other side, the single golden seed of the stolen glance is placed, and the scale tips dramatically in its favor. It is not just 'half the pleasure' ('செம்பாகம் அன்று'), but far 'greater' ('பெரிது')."
