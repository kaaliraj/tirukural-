      "Foreground": "A person is walking the path of life. Their path is illuminated by a powerful, protective aura generated by their vow of non-killing ('கொல்லாமை மேற்கொண்டு').",
      "Midground": "The God of Death, Yama ('கூற்று'), is shown approaching, his purpose to reap the person's life ('உயிர் உண்ணும்').",
      "Background": "As Yama reaches the edge of the person's protective aura of non-violence, he is stopped. He cannot proceed ('செல்லாது'). He is shown lowering his weapon and turning aside, unable to claim the life of one who has never taken a life. The vow of non-killing has granted them immunity from Death itself."

      "Subject_and_Action": "The God of Death will not take the life of a person who lives by the great principle of not killing.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The aura of non-violence as an impenetrable shield against Death is the central metaphor. Yama is not defeated in a battle, but his own law is superseded by the higher law of non-violence. His turning aside is an act of recognition and respect for this higher law.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Immunity, protected, transcendent, divine law.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The person's aura is a pure, powerful, white-gold light of life. Yama is a being of immense, dark, and terrifying power, but this power is shown to be nullified by the person's virtue. The scene is a standoff where light peacefully overpowers darkness.",
