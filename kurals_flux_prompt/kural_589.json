    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "Three spies are shown operating independently in the same location, but they are completely unaware of each other's presence ('ஒற்றெற் றுணராமை'). They are like three separate rays of light.",
      "Midground": "The three spies are sending their reports back to a central point—the king's mind.",
      "Background": "In the king's mind, the three separate rays of light (the reports) converge. If the reports are the same, the three rays merge into a single, brilliant, white beam of confirmed truth ('சொற்றொக்க தேறப்படும்'). If they differ, they create a discordant, chaotic pattern."

    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "One must manage spies so they don't know each other. Intelligence should only be trusted when the independent reports of three spies align.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The spies as independent rays of light represents their operational independence. The convergence of these rays into a single, pure beam is a powerful metaphor for confirmed intelligence.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Secretive, independent, convergent, certain.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The spies operate in shadows. Their reports are beams of light. The final, confirmed truth is a brilliant flash of pure white light.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "A multi-paneled shot showing the three spies operating separately, and then a central panel showing the convergence of their reports.",
        "Resolution": "8K, with abstract and beautiful light beam effects.",
        "Lighting": "The convergence of light provides the climactic illumination of the scene.",
