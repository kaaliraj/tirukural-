      "Foreground": "A false friend ('இனமல்லார்') is shown. Their bond of friendship is not a steady light, but a flickering, shape-shifting, and unpredictable flame.",
      "Midground": "The nature of this flame is compared directly to the mind of a courtesan ('மகளிர் மனம்'). Her mind is also depicted as a constantly changing, mercurial substance, never the same from one moment to the next.",
      "Background": "The friendship is shown rapidly changing its form—one moment it is a warm, inviting fire, the next it is a cold, distant wisp, and the next a raging, destructive blaze ('வேறுபடும்')."

      "Subject_and_Action": "The friendship of those who are not true kin is as changeable and unreliable as the mind of a courtesan.",
