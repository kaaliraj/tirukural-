      "Foreground": "A man with a deceitful mind ('வஞ்ச மனத்தான்') is putting on a public show of false, holy conduct ('படிற்று ஒழுக்கம்'). He looks pious and virtuous to the outside world.",
      "Midground": "A surreal, transparent, x-ray view into his own body reveals a hidden, internal audience.",
      "Background": "The five elements that make up his body—Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether—are personified as five small, elemental spirits. They are watching his hypocritical performance from the inside, and they are shown pointing and laughing scornfully ('அகத்தே நகும்') at the absurdity of his deceit. His own body is his most intimate and contemptuous audience."
