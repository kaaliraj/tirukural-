      "Foreground": "A person is shown giving a gift to a truly destitute and poor person ('வறியார்க்கு'). This act is depicted as a pure, selfless, and unconditional gift. It glows with a brilliant, white light, and is labeled 'True Charity' ('ஈகை').",
      "Midground": "In contrast, another person is shown giving a gift to a wealthy peer or someone who can repay them. This act is depicted as a calculated transaction.",
      "Background": "The second gift is shown to have an invisible, spectral thread of expectation attached to it, leading back to the giver. It has the nature of seeking a 'measured return' ('குறிஎதிர்ப்பை'). This transactional gift does not glow with the pure light of true charity."

      "Subject_and_Action": "True charity is defined as giving to the destitute with no expectation of return. All other forms of giving are merely transactions seeking a future benefit.",
