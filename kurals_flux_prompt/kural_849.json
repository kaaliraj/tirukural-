      "Foreground": "A wise teacher is trying to show an ignorant person a beautiful, complex, and true vision of the world.",
      "Midground": "The ignorant person, who cannot see this true vision ('காணாதான்'), is nonetheless confidently explaining his own, completely wrong and simplistic version of reality. His version is a childish, crayon drawing compared to the teacher's masterpiece.",
      "Background": "The ultimate folly is that the ignorant person is completely convinced that their own childish drawing is the true and correct one ('கண்டானாம் தான்கண்டவாறு'), and they are trying to 'teach' the teacher."
