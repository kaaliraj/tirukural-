      "Midground": "Instead of being happy for them, the envious person is shown actively trying to destroy their neighbor's good fortune, perhaps by throwing mud on their beautiful house.",
      "Background": "Because of this envious action, two divine figures are shown turning their backs and walking away from the envious person. One is the goddess of Virtue ('అறன்'). The other is the goddess of Wealth ('ஆக்கம்'). The image clearly states that by his envious act, he has proven he desires neither ('வேண்டாதான்')."
