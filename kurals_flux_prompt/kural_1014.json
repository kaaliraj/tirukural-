    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A stark contrast. On one side, a 'Saandror' (dignified person) walks with a stately gait ('Peedu Nadai'). They are adorned with a beautiful, glowing piece of jewelry representing 'Naan' (modesty), which completes their noble appearance.",
      "Midground": "On the other side, another person attempts the same stately walk, but they lack the ornament of modesty. Their proud walk ('Peedu Nadai') appears awkward, grotesque, and painful, as if they are afflicted with a disease ('Pini'). Their limbs are subtly twisted and unnatural.",
      "Background": "A grand, respectful hall that admires the first person's walk, but looks away with pity and discomfort from the second."

      "Lighting_and_Color": "The modest person is bathed in a warm, flattering light. The shameless person is lit with a harsh, clinical light that exposes the ugliness of their gait. A palette of noble golds vs. sickly greens."
