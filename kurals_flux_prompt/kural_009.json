      "Foreground": "In the foreground, a figure stands proudly, head held high and unbowed. Their eyes, ears, and other sense organs are depicted as grey, stone-like, and lifeless statues.",
      "Midground": "Slightly behind and to the side, another figure is shown from the back, head bowed in reverence before a divine light. In contrast to the first figure, their senses are vibrant and alive, visualized as streams of colorful light and energy flowing into them.",
      "Background": "In the deep background, the source of reverence is subtly implied: a radiant throne from which eight distinct rays of light (representing the 'eight attributes') emanate, illuminating the bowing figure. The divine feet are visible at the base of the throne."

    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "A direct comparison between a life of arrogant pride, which renders the senses useless, and a life of humility, which awakens true perception and makes the senses meaningful.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The proud figure's world around them is desaturated and grey, reflecting their lack of true perception. The bowing figure's world is rich with color and texture. The eight rays of light have distinct colors, symbolizing the multifaceted nature of the divine.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "A powerful and stark contrast between lifeless pride and vibrant humility.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "Split-composition color palette. The side with the proud figure is monochromatic, cold, and stony grey. The side with the bowing figure is bathed in the warm, multi-colored glow of the eight divine rays."
