      "Midground": "The source of their victory is shown by what they lack. Three monstrous, defeated beasts lie dead at their feet, representing the three evils they are free from.",
      "Background": "The three beasts are: a small, dwindling creature for 'diminution' ('சிறுமை'); a hateful, spiteful creature for 'aversion/mutiny' ('செல்லாத் துனி'); and a gaunt, skeletal creature for 'poverty' ('வறுமை'). The army is victorious because it was never afflicted by these internal weaknesses."
