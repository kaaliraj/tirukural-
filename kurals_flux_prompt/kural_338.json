      "Foreground": "An empty, broken eggshell ('குடம்பை') is left alone in a nest. It is a beautiful but now useless container.",
      "Midground": "From this broken shell, a beautiful, strong bird ('புள்'), representing the soul, is seen taking flight and soaring into the sky, leaving the shell behind without a backward glance.",
      "Background": "The scene is a direct and powerful metaphor for the relationship between the body and the soul ('உடம்பொடு உயிர் இடை நட்பு'). The body is a temporary vessel, and the soul's nature is to leave it behind and fly free."

    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "The relationship between the soul and the body is as temporary as that of a bird to the eggshell it hatches from and abandons.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The brokenness of the shell is not tragic, but a sign of a successful transition. The bird is not sad to leave; it is fulfilling its nature by flying away. The 'friendship' is one of temporary utility, not permanent attachment.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Liberating, natural, transient, unsentimental.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "A bright, clear, morning light illuminates the scene, symbolizing a new beginning for the soul-bird. The empty shell is in the slight shadow of the nest, its purpose now fulfilled. The palette is natural and hopeful.",

        "Camera": "A shot from inside the nest, looking up past the broken shell at the bird soaring into the vast, open sky.",
