      "Foreground": "A wise person ('வித்தகர்') is shown making a profound choice.",
      "Midground": "They have two bodies: a physical, mortal body of flesh, and a second, ethereal body of Fame. They are shown deliberately allowing their physical body to endure ruin and loss ('கேடு') and even death ('சாக்காடு').",
      "Background": "This sacrifice of the physical is shown to be a transfer of energy. As the physical body withers and dies, the ethereal body of Fame grows stronger, more solid, and more prosperous ('நத்தம் போல்'), becoming eternal. Only the wise can make this exchange."
