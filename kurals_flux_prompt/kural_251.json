      "Foreground": "A man is shown eating meat ('பிறிது ஊன் உண்பான்'). As he eats, his own body ('தன் ஊன்') is shown unnaturally swelling and growing larger ('பெருக்கற்கு').",
      "Midground": "A beautiful, radiant, divine figure representing Compassion ('அருள்') is shown watching him.",
      "Background": "The divine figure of Compassion looks at the man's act with a sorrowful and disapproving expression, and then turns its back and walks away. The image poses the rhetorical question: How can such a person ever hope to possess or be ruled by Compassion? ('எங்ஙனம் ஆளும் அருள்?')."

      "Subject_and_Action": "A visual rhetorical question showing the incompatibility of eating flesh and possessing compassion. The one who eats another's flesh to fatten his own is fundamentally abandoned by the virtue of Grace.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The unnatural swelling of the flesh-eater's body shows the grotesque nature of the act. The personification of Compassion as a divine being who actively rejects the flesh-eater makes the moral judgment clear.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Incompatible, rejected, sorrowful, condemnation.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The flesh-eater's scene is lit with a harsh, gluttonous, slightly grotesque light. The figure of Compassion is a source of pure, gentle, white light. As it turns away, its light recedes, leaving the man in the darkness of his own cruelty.",
