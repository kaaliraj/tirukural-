      "Midground": "Because he is blinded by affection, he is choosing a clearly incompetent and ignorant person ('அறிவறியார்') for a vital task, like commanding an army or building a bridge. The ignorant person is shown fumbling with the tools of the trade.",
      "Background": "The result of this choice is a scene of disaster: the army is in disarray, the bridge is collapsing. This represents the ultimate folly ('பேதைமை எல்லாந் தரும்') brought about by his biased decision."
