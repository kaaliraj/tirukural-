      "Foreground": "A person is shown receiving a great treasure. The treasure, however, is made of ice, beautiful but visibly melting, representing the perishable nature of wealth ('அற்கா இயல்பிற்றுச் செல்வம்').",
      "Midground": "Without hesitation ('ஆங்கே'), the person takes the melting treasure and uses it to perform an imperishable act. They use the melting water to nourish a small, sacred sapling, representing an act of virtue ('அற்குப').",
      "Background": "As they nourish the sapling, it instantly grows into a magnificent, eternal, crystalline tree that will never decay. They have successfully converted the impermanent into the permanent."
