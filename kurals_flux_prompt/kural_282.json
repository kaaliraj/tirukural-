      "Foreground": "A person is shown simply thinking. Their mind is visualized as a clear, calm pool of water.",
      "Midground": "A single thought forms in their mind: 'Let me steal that person's wealth' ('பிறன் பொருளைக் கள்வேம்'). The moment this thought appears, it manifests as a drop of black, poisonous ink.",
      "Background": "The single drop of ink touches the surface of the clear pool of the mind and instantly corrupts the entire pool, turning it dark, murky, and foul. This shows that the thought itself ('உள்ளலும் தீதே') is the evil, not just the subsequent action."

      "Lighting_and_Color": "The scene begins with the pure, bright clarity of the clear pool. The introduction of the single black drop causes a dramatic and instant shift to a dark, polluted, and ugly color palette.",
