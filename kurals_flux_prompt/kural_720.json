      "Foreground": "A person is speaking profound words of wisdom before an assembly of unworthy, foolish people who are not of their kind ('தங்கணத்தார் அல்லார் முன்').",
      "Midground": "The profound words are visualized as a stream of precious, divine ambrosia ('அமிழ்து') flowing from the speaker's mouth.",
      "Background": "Because the audience is unworthy and unable to receive it, the divine ambrosia does not reach them. Instead, it falls uselessly into a dirty, squalid sewer drain in the middle of the courtyard ('அங்கணத்துள் உக்க'), where it is completely wasted. The audience is shown to be oblivious to the precious substance being wasted before them."
