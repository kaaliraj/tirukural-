      "Foreground": "A person is shown trying to live their life, but they are unaware of a hidden internal enemy ('உட்பகை').",
      "Midground": "This internal enmity is visualized as a tiny, almost invisible crack forming inside the very foundation of their being. In a parallel image, a potter's cutting tool ('மட்பகை') is shown easily slicing through a block of wet clay.",
      "Background": "At a moment of crisis or ruin ('உலைவிடத்து'), the tiny, ignored crack of internal enmity suddenly and catastrophically shatters the person's entire being, just as the potter's tool cuts the clay. The destruction is swift, precise, and total ('மாணத் தெறும்')."
