      "Foreground": "A young person is shown performing a virtuous act now ('அறஞ்செய்க'), such as planting a sapling with great care.",
      "Midground": "A temporal transition: the sapling grows into a mighty, sheltering tree. Under this tree, an aged version of the same person is seen on their deathbed ('பொன்றுங்கால்'), looking peaceful.",
      "Background": "From the tree, a luminous, ethereal companion ('பொன்றாத் துணை') emerges, taking the soul of the dying person by the hand and leading them towards a gentle, celestial light. The companion is the personification of the virtue they practiced in their youth."
