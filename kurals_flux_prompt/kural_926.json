      "Foreground": "A diptych of two parallel comparisons. On the top panel, a sleeping person ('துஞ்சினார்') is shown lying next to a dead person ('செத்தார்'). Their appearance is almost identical, showing that sleep is like a temporary death.",
      "Midground": "On the bottom panel, a person drinking wine ('கள்ளுண்பவர்') is shown next to a person drinking a flask of bubbling poison marked with a skull and crossbones ('நஞ்சுண்பார்').",
      "Background": "The image makes the two comparisons direct and equal: the state of the sleeper is to the dead as the state of the drinker is to the poison-eater. Both are self-inflicted states that mimic a greater evil."
