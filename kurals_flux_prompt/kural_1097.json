      "Foreground": "A lover is shown giving their beloved a hateful-seeming look ('செற்றார் போல் நோக்கும்') and speaking a slightly harsh, small word ('செறாஅச் சிறுசொல்லும்').",
      "Midground": "This is all a performance. They are trying to act like a stranger ('உறாஅர் போன்று').",
      "Background": "However, their true intention is revealed. This feigned anger and distance is actually a subtle, coded sign ('குறிப்பு') of their deep love ('உற்றார்'). It is a playful test or an invitation, the meaning of which is the opposite of the surface appearance."

      "Subject_and_Action": "The seemingly harsh words and angry looks of a lover are often just a sign—a playful pretense of being a stranger—from one who is actually deeply attached.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The outward expression (angry look, harsh word) is a mask. A transparent overlay could reveal the true, loving heart beneath. The entire act is a 'sign' to be decoded by the other lover.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Coded, playful, paradoxical, feigned anger.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The scene has a romantic and intimate atmosphere, which makes the feigned anger feel playful rather than genuinely threatening. The underlying love can be hinted at with a warm glow from the person's heart, which contradicts their angry face.",

        "Camera": "A close-up that captures the lover's face, showing the angry expression but with a subtle, playful twinkle in the eye that betrays their true feeling.",
