      "Midground": "However, the king and his people are shown in a state of discord ('வேந்தமைவு இல்லாத'). They are turning their backs on each other, arguing, and there is a visible, crackling energy of conflict between them.",
      "Background": "Because of this lack of harmony, all the perfect resources of the land are going to waste. The fruits are rotting on the trees, the fields are untended, and the fortress is unmanned. The land, though perfect, is yielding no benefit ('பயமின்றே')."
