They hold their tongue, not speaking before their elders ('முந்து கிளவா'). This act of restraint is visualized as a beautiful, glowing gem of humility forming in their heart.",
      "Background": "All the other good qualities of the scholar—their intelligence, their eloquence, their knowledge—are shown as smaller, orbiting lights.
