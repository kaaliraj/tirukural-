      "Foreground": "A person is shown in a state of being unable to give ('ஈதல் இயையாக் கடை'). Their hands are empty, and a needy person stands before them, but they have nothing to offer.",
      "Midground": "This state of being unable to give is shown to be a pain 'worse than death' ('சாதலின் இன்னாதது').",
      "Background": "For comparison, the state of death ('சாதல்') is shown. It is depicted as a peaceful, gentle release. The image makes the shocking declaration that even this peaceful death would be a 'sweet' ('இனிது') alternative to the profound pain of living a life where one is unable to practice charity."

      "Subject_and_Action": "There is no greater pain than being unable to give to the needy; even death itself would be a sweet relief in comparison to that state.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The key is the elevation of the pain of being unable to give above the ultimate pain of death. The person's expression is not of poverty, but of a deep, spiritual agony born from their inability to fulfill their charitable nature.
