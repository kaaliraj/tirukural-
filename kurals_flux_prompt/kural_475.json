    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A large, sturdy cart ('சாகாடு') is being loaded with peacock feathers ('பீலி'). The feathers are individually light and beautiful.",
      "Midground": "However, the loading is excessive. A mountain-sized pile of feathers is being heaped onto the cart, far beyond its capacity ('சால மிகுத்துப் பெயின்').",
      "Background": "Under the immense, accumulated weight of the feathers, the strong axle of the cart ('அச்சு') is shown dramatically snapping in two, causing the entire cart to collapse."
    },
    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "A powerful visual lesson on limits: even the lightest of things, when accumulated in excessive quantity, can break the strongest support.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The contrast between the lightness of a single feather and the immense, destructive weight of the pile is the core concept. The snapping axle is the dramatic climax, proving the point.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Dramatic, surprising, cautionary, a lesson in physics and metaphor.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "Bright, vibrant colors for the peacock feathers to emphasize their individual beauty and seeming harmlessness. The lighting should be dramatic at the moment the axle snaps.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "A low-angle shot, looking up at the massive pile of feathers, emphasizing its overwhelming scale just before the axle breaks.",
        "Resolution": "8K, ultra-realistic, with detailed textures on the wood of the cart and the feathers. Slow-motion effect for the breaking axle.",
        "Lighting": "Clear, natural light that turns dramatic as the structure fails.",
        "Art_Genre": "Hyperrealism, with a focus on dramatic tension."
