      "Foreground": "A side-by-side depiction: on one side, a wealthy man with an empty coffer, unable to give alms ('தானம்'). On the other, a sage in a forest, his penance ('தவம்') interrupted, looking up at the sky with a parched throat.",
      "Midground": "The background for both figures is a barren, drought-stricken world ('வியன்உலகம்'), showing that the failure of both charity and penance stems from the same root cause.",
