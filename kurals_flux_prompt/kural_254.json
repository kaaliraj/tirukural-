    "English_Meaning": "If it be asked what is kindness and what its opposite, the answer would be preservation and destruction of life; and therefore it is not right to feed on the flesh (obtained by taking away life)."

      "Foreground": "A divine, cosmic balance scale is shown, weighing two pairs of concepts.",
      "Midground": "On the right side of the scale, the act of 'not killing' ('கொல்லாமை') is placed. This is equated with a glowing orb of pure light labeled 'Grace/Compassion' ('அருள்'). On the left side, the act of 'killing' ('கோறல்') is placed. This is equated with a dark, shadowy orb labeled 'Lack of Grace' ('அருள் அல்லது').",
      "Background": "The second part of the judgment is then shown. Based on this, the act of 'eating that flesh' ('அவ்வூன் தினல்') is weighed and found to be on the side of darkness, defined as a meaningless, worthless, and non-virtuous act ('பொருள் அல்லது')."

      "Subject_and_Action": "A logical and moral definition: if Grace is not-killing and Lack of Grace is killing, then it follows logically that eating the flesh that comes from killing is an act devoid of any true substance or virtue.",

      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Logical, definitive, judgmental, clear.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The right side of the scale (Grace, Not-Killing) is bathed in a pure, white, divine light. The left side (Lack of Grace, Killing, Flesh-eating) is mired in a dark, corrupting shadow.",
