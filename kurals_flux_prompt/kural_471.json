      "Midground": "On the scales, he is carefully placing symbolic weights. On the first scale, a representation of the task's difficulty (a heavy, rocky object for 'வினைவலி'). On the second, a symbol of his own army's strength ('தன்வலி'). On the third, the enemy's strength ('மாற்றான் வலி'). On the fourth, the strength of all allies ('துணைவலி').",
