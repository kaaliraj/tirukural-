      "Foreground": "A person is shown with their primary focus on guarding their tongue ('நா காக்க'). This is visualized as them gently but firmly holding a lock over their own mouth.",
      "Midground": "All around them, other aspects of their life are shown unguarded ('யா காவாராயினும்')—their wealth is exposed, their gates are open—but these are shown to be of secondary importance.",
      "Background": "A contrasting vision shows the terrible consequence of failing to guard the tongue. A single 'slip of the tongue' ('சொல் இழுக்கு') is visualized as a serpent leaping from the mouth, which then turns back and bites the speaker, causing them to be overwhelmed by a dark cloud of sorrow and regret ('சோகாப்பர்')."

      "Subject_and_Action": "The supreme importance of guarding one's tongue above all else, because a slip of the tongue results in immense misery.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The lock on the mouth is a direct symbol of control. The slip of the tongue as a self-biting serpent is a powerful metaphor for the self-inflicted nature of the resulting sorrow.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Vigilant, disciplined, cautionary, self-inflicted sorrow.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The person guarding their tongue is in a clear, controlled light. The vision of the consequence is dark and chaotic, with the serpent and the cloud of sorrow depicted in sickly, poisonous colors.",

        "Camera": "A split-screen or a main shot with a clear 'vision bubble' to show both the disciplined act and the dire consequences of failing.",
