      "Midground": "On the left, his mind is shown as having forgotten the Vedas ('மறப்பினும் ஓத்து'). However, he is shown re-learning by diligently studying the sacred texts, and the forgotten knowledge is visibly returning to him as streams of light ('கொளலாகும்'). His status remains intact.",
      "Background": "On the right, the same Brahmin is shown committing a single act that is a failure in decorum ('ஒழுக்கம் குன்ற'). The moment he does this, his high birth and status, visualized as a radiant, holy thread and a divine aura, instantly shatters and perishes ('பிறப்பு கெடும்')."

      "Lighting_and_Color": "The re-learning scene is lit with a hopeful, intellectual light. The scene of the lapse in conduct is marked by a sudden, violent flash of light as the aura shatters, followed by a dark, empty void of lost status.",
