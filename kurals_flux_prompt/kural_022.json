      "Foreground": "An ancient Tamil scholar sits before a vast, empty scroll, his writing stylus poised but unmoving, his face a mask of awe and futility.",
      "Midground": "The scholar's gaze is fixed on a cosmic vision unfolding before him: a vast, swirling galaxy where each star represents a measure of a renunciant's greatness ('துறந்தார் பெருமை').",
      "Background": "The galaxy stretches into infinity, filled with countless stars, symbolizing the impossibility of the task. Another faint visual layer shows ghostly, numberless figures of all who have ever lived and died ('இறந்தாரை எண்ணுதல்'), reinforcing the theme of infinite count."
