      "Foreground": "A beautifully built, opulent house, filled with immense riches, extravagant art, and symbols of worldly success ('எனைமாட்சித்').",
      "Midground": "However, the house is in a state of subtle decay and chaos. Dust motes dance in the light, food is left unfinished, and there is a palpable sense of emotional coldness and disorder.",
      "Background": "At the heart of the house sits the wife, depicted without the glow of 'domestic excellence' ('மனைமாட்சி'). She looks beautiful but is disengaged and listless, representing the absent core that renders all the external wealth meaningless."

      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The wealth is depicted as cold and metallic, lacking the warmth of a real home. The wife's lack of 'Manaimaatchi' is visualized as a lack of inner light or color; she is almost a grey figure in a colorful but chaotic room.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Empty, hollow, worthless despite wealth, lacking a soul, chaotic.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "Harsh, cold light streams in from outside, highlighting the dust and disorder. The colors of the riches are vibrant but clash with each other, creating a sense of visual noise rather than harmony. The wife herself is in muted, desaturated tones.",

        "Camera": "Ultra-wide shot to capture the scale of the wealth and the pervasive sense of emptiness and disorder simultaneously.",
