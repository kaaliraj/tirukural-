      "Foreground": "A person is shown decisively turning their back on and abandoning all the actions that the world condemns ('உலகம் பழித்தது ஒழித்து விடின்'). These are represented as a pile of dark, ugly, broken objects.",
      "Midground": "Because they have made this core, internal choice, their outward appearance is shown to be irrelevant.",
      "Background": "Two spectral, unnecessary versions of the person are shown fading away. One has a shaven head ('மழித்தல்'), the other has long, matted hair ('நீட்டல்'). The image makes it clear that these external signs of piety are 'not needed' ('வேண்டா') once the internal change has been made."

        "Camera": "A shot that focuses on the person's powerful act of renouncing evil deeds, with the external ascetic appearances shown as fading, secondary ghosts.",
