      "Midground": "His beloved's reaction is shown in two rapid stages. First, she instinctively follows custom and blesses him ('வழுத்தினாள்').",
      "Background": "A split second later, her mind connects the sneeze to the old superstition that a sneeze means someone is thinking of you. Her expression instantly changes to one of tragic jealousy. She begins to weep ('அழித்து அழுதாள்'), accusingly asking the question, 'Who was thinking of you to make you sneeze?' ('யார் உள்ளித் தும்மினீர்?')."
