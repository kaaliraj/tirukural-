      "Foreground": "A person stands before a magnificent, fruit-laden tree. On one branch hang beautiful, ripe, luscious, glowing fruits ('கனி'). On another branch hang sour, unripe, thorny, unappealing fruits ('காய்').",
      "Midground": "The person deliberately reaches past the ripe fruit to pluck and eat the unripe one, their face contorting with the sour taste.",
      "Background": "The tree represents the possibilities of speech. The ripe fruit is labeled 'Iniya' (pleasant words), and the unripe fruit is labeled 'Innatha' (unpleasant words)."

    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "A direct and vivid simile: choosing to speak harsh words when sweet ones are available is as foolish and self-punishing as choosing to eat sour, unripe fruit when ripe fruit is readily available.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The ripe fruit is depicted as almost magically delicious and life-giving. The unripe fruit is not just green, but actively unpleasant-looking. The person's choice is clearly irrational and leads to immediate negative consequences (the sour expression).",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Foolish, illogical, self-punishing, irrational choice.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The side of the tree with the ripe fruit is bathed in a warm, golden, delicious light. The side with the unripe fruit is in a cooler, less appealing light. The colors clearly distinguish between the appealing and unappealing choices.",

        "Camera": "A clear, illustrative shot that captures the tree, the two types of fruit, and the person making the foolish choice.",
        "Resolution": "8K, hyper-realistic, with a strong focus on the textures that make the ripe fruit look delicious and the unripe fruit look sour.",
        "Lighting": "Naturalistic but symbolic lighting to guide the viewer's interpretation of the choices.",
        "Art_Genre": "Allegorical realism, still life with narrative elements."
