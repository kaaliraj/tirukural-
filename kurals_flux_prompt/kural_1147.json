      "Foreground": "The young woman's love-sickness ('Innoi') is visualized as a single, rapidly growing, thorny vine that is wrapped around her.",
      "Midground": "The gossip of the townspeople ('Ooravar Kavvai') is depicted as rich, dark fertilizer ('Eru') being spread at the base of the vine, making it grow thicker and stronger.",
      "Background": "Her mother ('Annai') is shown with a watering can, but instead of water, her harsh words ('Annai Sol') flow out as a stream of liquid ('Neer') that nourishes the thorny vine, making it grow even faster."
