      "Foreground": "A split composition. On the left, a family's ancestral home is shown with a single crack of fire running through it, caused by a descendant failing in their principles ('Kolkai Pizhaippin'). The fire burns the lineage ('Kulam Sudum').",
      "Midground": "On the right, an individual stands devoid of any modesty ('Naaninmai'). They are being consumed by an all-encompassing, far more intense fire that burns away every single one of their personal good qualities ('Nalam Sudum'), leaving nothing but ash.",
