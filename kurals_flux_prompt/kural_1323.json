      "Midground": "They are engaged in a playful, feigned quarrel ('புலத்தல்').",
      "Background": "A vision of the blissful world of the gods ('புத்தேள் நாடு') appears. However, the pleasure shown in the celestial realm is depicted as being less intense, less vibrant, and less joyful than the pleasure the couple is deriving from their intimate, playful pouting. The image rhetorically asks, 'Is there a heaven better than this?' ('உண்டோ?')."
