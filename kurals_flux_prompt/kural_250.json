      "Foreground": "A strong man is about to act cruelly towards a person weaker than him ('மெலியார்மேல் செல்லு மிடத்து'). His arm is raised, his face aggressive.",
      "Midground": "In that instant, a ghostly, vivid memory materializes before his eyes. It shows him as a much weaker figure, trembling with fear before someone far stronger and more powerful than himself ('வலியார்முன்').",
      "Background": "The memory is so powerful that it forces him to see himself in his current victim. He lowers his arm, his aggression replaced by a dawning of empathy and self-awareness ('தன்னை நினைக்க')."

      "Subject_and_Action": "The ultimate check against bullying the weak is to force oneself to remember the feeling of being weak in the presence of the strong.",

      "Lighting_and_Color": "The present scene is lit with harsh, aggressive light. The memory vision is lit with a cold, fearful light. The moment of realization should be marked by a shift to a softer, more thoughtful lighting on the man's face.",
