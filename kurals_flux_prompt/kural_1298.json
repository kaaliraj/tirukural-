      "Foreground": "A woman's heart ('நெஞ்சு') is shown at a crossroads of thought.",
      "Midground": "One path is to despise her lover ('எள்ளின்'). A vision on this path shows that this would lead to her own disgrace and sorrow ('இளிவாம்'). The other path is to think of his good qualities ('அவர் திறம் உள்ளும்').",
      "Background": "The heart, which is described as having a deep love for its own life and well-being ('உயிர்க் காதல்'), deliberately chooses the second path. It is shown lovingly counting her lover's virtues like a string of prayer beads, choosing this thought process as an act of self-preservation to avoid the sorrow of the other path."
