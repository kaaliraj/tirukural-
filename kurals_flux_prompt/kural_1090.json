      "Midground": "On the left, a person is drinking wine ('கள்'). The pleasure from the wine is shown as a glow that exists only inside their body after they have drunk it ('உண்டார்கண் அல்லது'). Onlookers see nothing special.",
      "Background": "On the right, a lover is simply looking at his beloved ('கண்டார்'). The mere sight of her creates an immense, radiant aura of joy and delight ('மகிழ்செய்தல்') that surrounds him, visible to all. The image shows that Love ('காமம்') has this special power that wine lacks."

      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The internal, contained glow of the wine's pleasure versus the external, radiant aura of love's pleasure is the key visual distinction. Love's power is shown to be superior because it works at a distance, through sight alone.",
