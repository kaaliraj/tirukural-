      "Midground": "On the right, a king stands alone without any supporters or strong counselors ('சார்பு இல்லார்க்கு'). The ground beneath his throne is cracking and crumbling, showing he has no stability ('நிலை இல்லை'). The supporting pillars of his hall are shown to be weak and thin like twigs ('மதலையாம்').",
