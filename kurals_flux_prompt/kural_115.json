      "Foreground": "A wise sage ('சான்றோர்') stands in perfect, serene balance. Their mind ('நெஞ்சத்து') is visualized as a perfectly still, clear pool of water.",
      "Midground": "On one side, a shower of golden coins representing 'gain' ('பெருக்கம்') falls towards the sage. On the other side, a harsh, destructive wind representing 'loss' ('கேடு') blows towards them.",
      "Background": "Neither the gain nor the loss disturbs the perfect stillness of the pool of their mind. The coins land gently without a ripple, and the wind passes over without stirring the surface. This equanimity ('கோடாமை') is their true ornament ('அணி')."

    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "The true ornament of the wise is to maintain a perfectly unshaken and impartial mind, regardless of whether they are faced with great loss or great gain.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The still pool of the mind is the central metaphor. The external events of gain and loss are shown to be powerless against this inner stillness. The 'ornament' is not a physical thing, but this state of perfect balance.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Serene, balanced, equanimity, unshakable, wise.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "A clear, pure, centered light illuminates the sage. The shower of gold has a bright but fleeting glow, and the winds of loss are dark and transient. The light of the sage's inner peace is constant and unwavering.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "A centered, symmetrical shot that emphasizes the perfect balance of the sage against the opposing forces of gain and loss.",
        "Resolution": "8K, ultra-realistic, with beautiful liquid physics for the still pool and particle effects for the gold and wind.",
        "Lighting": "The sage's inner calm is represented by a soft, constant light that is unaffected by the external events.",
        "Art_Genre": "Symbolic portraiture, mystical realism."
