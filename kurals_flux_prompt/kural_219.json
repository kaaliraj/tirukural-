      "Foreground": "A benevolent person ('நயனுடையான்') is shown. Their heart is a brilliant, overflowing spring of generosity.",
      "Midground": "However, they have fallen into poverty ('நல்கூர்ந்தான் ஆதல்'). This is visualized as their hands being empty; they have no material goods to give.",
      "Background": "The true nature of their 'poverty' is revealed. It is not the lack of things for themselves, but the profound pain and inability to perform the good deeds they wish to do ('செய்யும் நீர செய்யாது அமைகலா ஆறு'). Their suffering is shown to be the frustration of their generous spirit, not their empty stomach."
