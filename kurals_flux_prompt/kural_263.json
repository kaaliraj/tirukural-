      "Foreground": "A group of householders ('மற்றையவர்கள்') are shown diligently working and providing sustenance (food, clothing) for a group of ascetics who have renounced the world ('துறந்தார்க்குத் துப்புரவு').",
      "Midground": "A cosmic, ethereal question mark hovers over the householders.",
      "Background": "The image poses a philosophical, slightly ironic question: Is the very reason that these householders have 'forgotten' to practice penance themselves ('மறந்தார்கொல் தவம்') because they are so busy with the essential duty of supporting those who *have* taken up that life? Their worldly work is presented as a different, but necessary, form of spiritual duty."
