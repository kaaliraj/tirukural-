      "Foreground": "A group of ministers who lack executive skill ('திறப்பாடு இலாதவர்') are shown with a perfect, glowing blueprint for a magnificent bridge ('முறைப்படச் சூழ்ந்தும்'). The plan is flawless.",
      "Midground": "However, when they try to execute the plan, their actions are clumsy and ineffective. They are dropping tools, misaligning stones, and arguing amongst themselves.",
      "Background": "As a result, the bridge they are building is a half-finished, chaotic ruin that is collapsing into the river. Their perfect plan leads to a failed outcome because they lack the ability to execute it ('முடிவிலவே செய்வர்')."
