      "Foreground": "A person is shown in the present, committing a cruel, unrighteous act ('அல்லவை செய்து'). They have clearly forsaken compassion ('அருள் நீங்கி').",
      "Midground": "A ghostly, transparent overlay shows their past life. In that past life, they were a wealthy and virtuous person ('பொருள்'), but they are depicted turning their back on virtue, thus 'losing' or 'separating' from it ('பொருள் நீங்கி').",
      "Background": "Another ghostly vision shows their future life, where they are suffering the exact same cruelties they are now inflicting. The person in the present is shown to be oblivious to both their past error and their future consequence, a state of profound forgetfulness ('பொச்சாந்தார்')."
