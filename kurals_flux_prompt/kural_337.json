      "Background": "Unseen by the person, the fine, single thread of their life is about to be snipped by a cosmic pair of shears, representing the fact that they are not guaranteed even another moment of life ('ஒரு பொழுதும் வாழ்வது அறியார்'). The shears are closing in, just a fraction of a second away from cutting the thread."
