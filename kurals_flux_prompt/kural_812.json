      "Foreground": "A central figure is shown at two different times. On the left, they are prosperous, surrounded by gold. A fair-weather friend is embracing them warmly ('உறின் நட்டு').",
      "Midground": "On the right, the central figure is shown in poverty, their gold gone. The same fair-weather friend is now walking away, abandoning them ('அறின் ஒருஉம்').",
      "Background": "A vast, cosmic scale of value is shown. The 'gaining' of this friendship and the 'losing' of it are placed on the scales, and the scales remain perfectly, emptily balanced, showing that both events have zero actual worth ('பெறினும் இழப்பினும் என்?')."
