      "Foreground": "A learned scholar ('கற்றறிந்தார்') is speaking. Their knowledge ('கல்வி') is visualized as a lamp they are holding.",
      "Midground": "In a dark or dimly lit room, the lamp appears to give off only a modest light. Then, they enter an assembly of true experts, those who can flawlessly analyze words ('கசடறச் சொல் தெரிதல் வல்லார்').",
      "Background": "The moment they are in the presence of these experts, the experts' keen attention acts like a series of mirrors. These mirrors catch the light from the scholar's lamp and reflect it, amplifying it a thousand times until the entire hall is brilliantly illuminated ('விளங்கும்')."
