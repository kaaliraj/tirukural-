      "Midground": "In this mind-scape, the path of justice ('நடுவு') is a straight, solid bridge. The person is choosing to step off this bridge ('ஒரீஇ') onto a treacherous, crumbling cliff edge representing the unjust act ('அல்ல செயின்').",
      "Background": "The moment they make this choice, a vision of their own future ruin ('கெடுவல் யான்') appears before them like a terrifying prophecy: their future self is seen falling into a dark abyss as the cliff edge gives way. This is the knowledge ('அறிக') that should stop them."
