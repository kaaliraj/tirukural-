      "Foreground": "A person has a clear, painful memory of something that caused them sorrow ('இன்னா எனத் தான் உணர்ந்தவை'). This memory is a sharp, red, thorny object in their mind.",
      "Midground": "They are now in a position where they have the opportunity to do the very same harmful act to another person ('பிறன்கண் செயல்').",
      "Background": "Because of their own memory of the pain, they make a conscious and determined choice to not even approach that action ('துன்னாமை வேண்டும்'). They are shown building a wall between themselves and the harmful deed, using the very thorns of their own painful memory as the building blocks of their compassionate restraint."
