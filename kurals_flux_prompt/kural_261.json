      "Foreground": "An ascetic is shown, embodying the two core principles of penance ('தவம்').",
      "Midground": "One aspect is their endurance of self-inflicted hardship ('உற்ற நோய் நோன்றல்'). This is visualized as them calmly bearing a heavy, painful, but self-chosen burden on their shoulders.",
      "Background": "The second, equally important aspect is their harmlessness to others ('உயிர்க்கு உறுகண் செய்யாமை'). This is visualized as a beautiful, protective aura that emanates from them, ensuring that no living creature, from a small insect to a large deer, is harmed by their presence. Birds and animals are safe around them."

    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "The true nature of penance is defined by a twofold discipline: the patient endurance of one's own chosen hardship, and the absolute non-harming of any other living being.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The two aspects—the internal burden and the external harmlessness—are shown in perfect balance. The hardship is a chosen discipline, not a miserable suffering. The protective aura is an active quality, not just a passive lack of violence.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Disciplined, balanced, serene, harmless, enduring.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "A clear, focused, and disciplined light. The ascetic's expression is one of serene endurance, not agony. The protective aura is a gentle, soft, white light. The palette is calm and centered.",

        "Camera": "A full-figure shot that clearly captures the ascetic, their self-imposed burden, and the protective, harmless aura that surrounds them.",
