      "Midground": "His lover sees this, and her mind instantly creates a suspicious, jealous vision. The vision shows a shadowy 'other woman' ('ஒருத்தியை').",
      "Background": "She then confronts her lover with her accusation, which materializes as text: 'For whose sake are you wearing that flower? You are showing off for her!' ('காட்டிய சூடினீர் என்று'). Her jealousy ('காயும்') is so creative that it can turn even the most innocent act into a sign of infidelity."
