      "Foreground": "A warrior is shown in the midst of a righteous battle, defending the innocent. His strength and valor ('மறம்') are visibly amplified by a fiery, passionate aura of Love ('அன்பு') for his people and his cause.",
      "Midground": "In contrast, a sage is shown performing an act of gentle virtue ('அறம்'), like healing the sick. His virtue is also powered by a calm, gentle aura of the same Love.",
      "Background": "A single, divine source of Love is depicted in the heavens, from which two distinct streams of energy flow down—one fiery and powerful to the warrior, one calm and gentle to the sage, showing that Love is the common source for both kinds of righteous action."
