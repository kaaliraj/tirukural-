      "Background": "He feels that his suffering is pointless ('எவன் மற்று'). The one person who had the unique ability to perceive and understand the true cause of his pain ('நொந்தார் என்று அஃதறியும் காதலர்') is absent ('இல்லா வழி'). Without the one who can understand it, his grief feels meaningless."
