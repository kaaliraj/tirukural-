      "Foreground": "A woman is shown with the sallow hue of lovesickness. The townspeople are pointing at her and she is accepting the name 'The Sallow One' ('பசப்பெனப் பேர் பெறுதல்').",
      "Midground": "Her acceptance of this personal shame is a willing sacrifice. It acts as a magical shield that protects the reputation of her absent lover.",
      "Background": "The shield is shown deflecting the dark, thorny words of gossip ('தூற்றார்') from the townspeople that would have otherwise flown towards her lover, accusing him of being unkind ('நல்காமை'). She would rather be shamed for her sickness than have him be shamed for his unkindness."
