      "Foreground": "A woman is depicted in a state of emotional ruin ('கெட்டார்'), abandoned by her lover. Her form is desolate.",
      "Midground": "Her own heart ('நெஞ்சே'), however, is not with her. It is shown as a separate figure, cheerfully and willfully following her absent lover ('அவர் பின் செலல்').",
      "Background": "A ghostly proverb materializes in the air, framing the scene: 'The ruined have no friends' ('கெட்டார்க்கு நட்டார் இல்'). The woman's question to her heart is visualized: 'Is it because you believe in this proverb that you, my last friend, are also abandoning me?'"
