      "Midground": "A thief or a natural disaster is shown taking all their wealth away, representing the inevitable loss of hoarded possessions ('இழக்கும்').",
      "Background": "A vision appears before the miser, showing the one thing they never experienced: the profound, radiant joy of giving ('ஈத்து உவக்கும் இன்பம்'). In this vision, a charitable person is giving to the needy, and their face is a picture of a sublime happiness that the miser never knew. The image poses the question: 'Do they not know this joy?' ('அறியார் கொல்?')."
