In the background, another courtier has fallen into one of the traps, representing a committed offense.",
      "Background": "The king's eye is shown in the sky above. The eye looking at the careful courtier is neutral. But the eye looking at the fallen courtier has transformed into a stone-like, permanently suspicious gaze ('கடுத்தபின்'). A ghostly figure is trying to plead for the fallen courtier, but the stone eye is unmoving; trust, once broken, cannot be restored ('தேற்றுதல் அரிது')."
