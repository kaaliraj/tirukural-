      "Midground": "Her gaze is the 'meek look of a fawn' ('பிணையேர் மட நோக்கு'), which is visualized as a soft, gentle light. Her demeanor is one of 'modesty' or 'shame' ('நாணும்'), which is visualized as a beautiful, glowing veil of light that naturally adorns her.",
      "Background": "Piles of external, foreign jewels and ornaments ('ஏதில அணி')—gold necklaces, diamond earrings—are lying on a table beside her. The image rhetorically asks 'Of what use are these?' ('எவனோ?'). They are shown to be dull and lifeless compared to her natural, radiant ornaments of character."
