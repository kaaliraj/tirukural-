      "Foreground": "A woman's heart ('என் நெஞ்சு'), personified as a naive and hopeful creature, is shown eagerly running towards her absent lover.",
      "Midground": "The woman's eyes ('கண்ணும்') are also personified, acting as wise, sad witnesses. They are shown holding up a sign or a vision that clearly shows the lover is unloving and distant ('உறாஅதவர்').",
      "Background": "Despite the clear evidence from the eyes, the foolish heart ignores the warning and continues its journey, driven by the naive belief that 'He will not be angry' ('செறாஅர் என'). The scene is one of a foolish heart overruling the wise senses."

      "Subject_and_Action": "The woman chides her foolish heart for continuing to run towards a lover who her own eyes have already confirmed is unloving, all based on the silly hope that he won't be displeased.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The conflict between the wise, seeing eyes and the foolish, feeling heart is the core of the image. The heart is a naive optimist, while the eyes are sad realists. The heart's journey is depicted as a futile one.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Foolish, naive, self-deception, futile hope.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The heart is surrounded by a bright, but naive and flimsy, bubble of hope. The eyes are in a clear, sad, realistic light. The distant lover is in a cold, indifferent light.",
