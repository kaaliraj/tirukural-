      "Foreground": "A split composition showing two opposing warriors.",
      "Midground": "On the left is a warrior driven by thoughtless covetousness ('எண்ணாது வெஃகின்'). Their greed is a chaotic, dark energy that leads them to fight recklessly. This path is shown to end abruptly in a pit of death and ruin ('இறல் ஈனும்').",
      "Background": "On the right is a warrior driven by the 'proud greatness of non-desire' ('வேண்டாமை என்னும் செருக்கு'). They are not fighting for gain, but from a place of self-possession and principle. This noble pride is a brilliant, focused aura of power that leads them to a decisive and glorious victory ('விறல் ஈனும்')."
