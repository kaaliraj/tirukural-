      "Foreground": "A split composition. On the right, a figure walks a straight, sunlit path of smooth stones, surrounded by lush greenery, representing the 'gain from virtue' (அறத்தினூஉங்கு ஆக்கமும்).",
      "Midground": "On the left, the same figure is lost and stumbling in a dark, dead forest of thorns, representing the 'ruin from forgetting virtue' (மறத்தலின் ஊங்கில்லை கேடு). The path here is broken and treacherous.",
      "Background": "The background mirrors the split: a bright, hopeful sky on the right, and a dark, stormy, oppressive sky on the left. The divide originates from the figure's choice point."
