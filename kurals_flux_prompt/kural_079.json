      "Foreground": "A perfectly formed, beautiful human statue, like a Greek or Roman ideal. It represents a body with perfect external limbs ('புறத்துறுப்பு').",
      "Midground": "However, the statue is made of cold, grey stone, and where the heart should be, there is only an empty, dark cavity. This represents the absence of the 'internal limb', Love ('அகத்துறுப்பு அன்பு').",
      "Background": "In the background, other, less physically perfect figures are shown interacting with warmth and joy. Their bodies might be old or plain, but they glow with an inner light of love, making them truly alive."
    },
    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "The utter uselessness of a physically perfect body if the essential inner organ of Love is missing. Without love, a person is just a beautiful but lifeless statue.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The contrast between the beautiful, perfect, but lifeless statue and the 'imperfect' but living people is central. The empty hole in the statue's chest is a stark visual representation of the missing love.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Hollow, lifeless, cold, contrasting inner life with outer form.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The statue is lit with cold, clinical, white light, emphasizing its stony texture. The living figures in the background are bathed in a warm, golden, emotional light.",

        "Camera": "A dramatic shot focusing on the statue, with a shallow depth of field to contrast it with the warm, living world behind it.",
