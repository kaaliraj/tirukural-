      "Foreground": "A person is in peril, perhaps trapped at the edge of a cliff. They reach out for help.",
      "Midground": "Their 'friend', who is a base and worthless person ('சிறியவர்'), is standing nearby. This friend is not malicious, but they are utterly weak and incapable of providing any real protection or help ('செய்து ஏமம் சாரா'). Their attempt to help is feeble and useless.",
      "Background": "A vision shows the alternative: if the person in peril had never made this friendship in the first place ('எய்தாமை'), they would be alone, but they would be more focused and perhaps able to save themselves. The false hope provided by the useless friend is shown to be worse than having no hope at all. It is better ('நன்று') to have never had such a friend."
