      "Foreground": "A virtuous person is shown being struck by a harsh, unjust injury ('திறன் அல்ல') from another person.",
      "Midground": "Instead of retaliating, the virtuous person's expression is one of pain for their own injury ('நோ'), but also one of deep compassion and sorrow ('நொந்து') for the attacker, pitying the bad karma the attacker has just created for themselves.",
      "Background": "The virtuous person is shown actively restraining themselves, lowering a hand that could have performed a counter-attack. This act of refraining from unrighteousness ('அறன் அல்ல செய்யாமை') is shown to be a 'good' and noble choice."

      "Subject_and_Action": "Even when suffering an unjust wrong, the better path is to feel sorrow for the wrongdoer's inevitable karmic consequence and to refrain from any unvirtuous retaliation.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The dual emotion on the victim's face is key: personal pain mixed with compassionate pity for the aggressor. A faint, shadowy vision of the aggressor's future suffering could be shown, which is what the virtuous person is seeing and pitying.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Compassionate, sorrowful, restrained, noble, self-controlled.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "A dramatic light highlights the virtuous person's pained yet compassionate face. The act of injury is a dark, shadowy motion. The potential retaliation is a dark energy that the person consciously dissipates.",
