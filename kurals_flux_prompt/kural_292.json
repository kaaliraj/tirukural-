      "Foreground": "A person is telling a falsehood, but with a pure intention. The spoken words are initially visualized as grey, misshapen forms, representing their literal untruth ('பொய்ம்மை').",
      "Midground": "These grey words travel towards a situation of great peril—perhaps an innocent person being hunted by a cruel tyrant. The words form a screen of illusion that misdirects the tyrant and saves the innocent person.",
      "Background": "Because the result of this falsehood is a 'faultless good' ('புரை தீர்ந்த நன்மை'), the grey, misshapen words, having achieved their noble purpose, transform into brilliant, pure, white forms, taking on the quality and place of Truth ('வாய்மை யிடத்த')."

      "Lighting_and_Color": "The scene begins with the neutral grey of the lie. The act of salvation is dramatic. The final transformation of the words into pure white light is the climactic moment, changing the entire lighting of the scene to one of virtuous purity.",

        "Camera": "A narrative shot that follows the trajectory of the lie from the speaker's mouth, showing its impact and its ultimate transformation into truth.",
