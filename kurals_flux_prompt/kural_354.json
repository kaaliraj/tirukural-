      "Foreground": "A person is shown who has perfected the knowledge of their five senses ('ஐயுணர்வு எய்திய'). This is visualized as them having five, perfectly functioning, crystal-clear eyes and ears, etc., that perceive the world with incredible detail.",
      "Midground": "They are looking at the universe. They can see all the details of the physical world, but they lack the 'knowledge of the True Thing' ('மெய்யுணர்வு').",
      "Background": "Because they lack this one, central understanding, all the perfect data from their five senses is shown to be meaningless. It is a chaotic jumble of information with no underlying pattern or meaning. There is 'no benefit' ('பயன் இன்றே'). The perfect sensory data leads to no wisdom or peace."

      "Lighting_and_Color": "A chaotic, flickering, multi-colored light from all the sensory data floods the scene. However, the person's expression is one of confusion and being overwhelmed, not enlightenment.",
