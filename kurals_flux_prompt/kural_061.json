      "Midground": "Behind the child, all other worldly treasures and acquisitions ('பெறுமவற்றுள் அல்ல பிற') are depicted—piles of gold, a royal crown, fertile lands, powerful armies. However, they are all shown in a faded, desaturated, and less significant manner.",
      "Background": "A divine scale of justice is faintly visible in the cosmos. On one side, all the worldly treasures are piled high, but the scale barely moves. On the other side, the single, intelligent child sits, and their side of the scale is weighed down heavily, proving their supreme value."
