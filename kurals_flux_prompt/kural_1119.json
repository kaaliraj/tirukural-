      "Background": "...then you must stop being a public object that appears for everyone to see ('பலர் காணத் தோன்றல்'). You must become a private treasure, seen only by me.' The moon is shown looking sad, as it cannot fulfill this condition."

      "Lighting_and_Color": "A soft, romantic moonlight. The beloved's face appears in a vision, and it is a secret, intimate beauty. The moon in the sky is a public, shared beauty. The distinction is subtle but crucial.",
