      "Background": "Outside the sphere, a dark and chaotic landscape represents the 'seven births' ('எழுபிறப்பு'). Menacing, shadowy forms representing evils ('தீயவை') and blame ('பழி') try to approach the parents, but they are repelled and dissolve upon touching the brilliant light generated by the child's virtue."
