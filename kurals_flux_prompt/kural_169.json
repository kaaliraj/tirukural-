      "Background": "A group of wise, thoughtful people are observing both scenes. They are not accepting them at face value, but are shown in deep contemplation, pondering the meaning and cause of these apparent injustices ('நினைக்கப்படும்'). Their thought process is the main subject of the image."

      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The crooked heart can be visualized as a dark, twisted shape, while the righteous heart is a straight, luminous line. The act of 'pondering' by the observers is the key action; they are trying to understand the deeper karmic reasons for these surface-level injustices.",
