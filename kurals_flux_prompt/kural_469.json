    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A person is shown performing what they believe to be a good deed ('நன்றாற்றல்'), for example, offering a beautiful musical instrument to another.",
      "Midground": "However, the recipient has no appreciation for music ('பண்பு அறியாது'). They look at the precious instrument with confusion or disdain, and it is clear the gift will be unused and unappreciated. The good deed has failed ('தவறு உண்டு').",
      "Background": "In a series of smaller vignettes, other similar failures are shown: offering a book to a man who cannot read, offering meat to a vegetarian. Each is a good intention that fails because the nature of the recipient was not considered."

    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "Even a good deed can become a failure if it is not tailored to the nature, character, and disposition of the recipient.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The disconnect between the giver's intention and the receiver's reality is the key. The 'failure' is not a disaster, but a quiet, sad lack of connection and wasted effort.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Misguided, failed good intentions, lack of understanding, poignant.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "A soft, slightly melancholic light. The gift is beautiful and well-intentioned, but the recipient's lack of appreciation casts a subtle shadow over the interaction.",

        "Camera": "A close-up on the faces, capturing the giver's earnest but misguided expression and the receiver's confused or indifferent one.",
