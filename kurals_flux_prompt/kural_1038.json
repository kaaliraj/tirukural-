      "Foreground": "A sequence of four essential farming actions is shown in a continuous, flowing landscape, representing the hierarchy of tasks.",
      "Midground": "First, ploughing ('ஏர்'). Second, and shown as more important, is manuring the field ('எரு இடுதல்'). Third, after the weeds are removed ('கட்ட பின்'), is watering ('நீர்').",
      "Background": "Finally, and shown as the most important, crowning action, is the farmer standing guard ('காப்பு') over the growing crops, protecting them from pests and thieves. Each successive action is presented as being 'better' ('நன்று') than the last."

      "Subject_and_Action": "A hierarchy of agricultural tasks: manuring is more important than ploughing, watering is more important than weeding, and guarding the crop is the most important of all.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The image should create a sense of escalating importance. This can be done through composition (placing guarding in the most prominent position) or through symbolic lighting, where the light becomes more golden and valuable with each successive, more important task.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Methodical, hierarchical, diligent, protective.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "A clear, bright, agricultural light. The value of each stage can be represented by an increasing glow, culminating in the golden light surrounding the final act of guarding the precious crop.",
