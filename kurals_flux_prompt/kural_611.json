    "Tamil_Text": "அருமை உடைத்தென்று அசாவாமை வேண்டும்பெருமை முயற்சி தரும்.",
    "English_Meaning": "Yield not to the feebleness which says, \"this is too difficult to be done\"; labour will give the greatness (of mind) which is necessary (to do it)."

    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A person stands at the base of a colossal, impossibly steep mountain, representing a deed that seems 'too difficult' ('அருமை உடைத்து'). A shadowy figure of Despair whispers in their ear, 'It is impossible'.",
      "Midground": "The person rejects this despair ('அசாவாமை வேண்டும்'). They begin to climb, and with each step of effort ('முயற்சி'), their own form grows larger, stronger, and more luminous, transforming into a figure of heroic 'greatness' ('பெருமை').",
      "Background": "By the time they reach the summit, they are a giant, heroic figure whose stature matches the mountain itself. The effort did not just conquer the task; it created the very greatness required to conquer it."
    },
    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "Effort itself is the force that creates the greatness needed to overcome seemingly impossible tasks. One should never give in to the despair of difficulty.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The transformation of the climber is the key visual. They do not start with the required greatness; they acquire it *through* the act of trying. The mountain does not shrink; the person grows to meet it.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Transformative, heroic, determined, empowering.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The base of the mountain is dark and shadowy, filled with the cold blues of despair. As the climber ascends, their effort generates a warm, golden light of 'greatness' that dispels the shadows. The summit is bathed in the brilliant light of accomplishment.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "A low-angle, vertical pan shot that follows the climber's ascent and transformation, emphasizing their growing heroic stature.",
        "Resolution": "8K, ultra-realistic, with dynamic scaling and glowing effects for the climber.",
        "Lighting": "The climber's own effort should be the primary light source that pushes back the darkness of the difficult task.",
        "Art_Genre": "Epic fantasy art, heroic realism."
