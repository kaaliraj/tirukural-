      "Midground": "On the left, a king is surrounded by jester-like friends ('நகைவகையர்') who are only capable of making him laugh. They offer no real counsel, only amusement. The king's kingdom is subtly shown to be decaying and unproductive in the background.",
      "Background": "On the right, the same king is facing a powerful and intelligent enemy ('பகைவர்'). The challenge from this enemy is forcing the king to become stronger, more strategic, and more virtuous. His kingdom in the background is shown to be growing strong and prosperous as a result of this challenge. The 'profit' from the enemy is immense."
