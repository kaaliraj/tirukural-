      "Midground": "The situation is a noble one: a gentle cow ('ஆ') is thirsty, and the person merely wants to ask for water for it ('நீர் என்று இரப்பினும்'). The intention is charitable.",
      "Background": "Despite the noble cause, the act of begging itself ('இரவு') is so inherently disgraceful ('இளிவந்தது') that the person's own tongue is visualized as being stained with a mark of shame. The image asserts that there is no greater disgrace for the tongue than the act of begging, regardless of the reason."
