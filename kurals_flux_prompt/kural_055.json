      "Foreground": "A woman of simple but profound dignity is shown rising in the early morning. She is not praying towards a temple or idol, but is respectfully bowing to her husband ('கொழுநன் தொழுதெழுவாள்').",
      "Midground": "Later in the day, the sky is clear and sunlit, but the land is parched. The woman looks up and softly utters the command, 'Peyyena' ('பெய்யென').",
      "Background": "In immediate response to her word, gentle, life-giving rain ('மழை') begins to fall from the clear blue sky, a miracle born directly from her virtue."
