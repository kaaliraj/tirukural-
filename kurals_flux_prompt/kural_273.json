      "Foreground": "A cow is shown, draped in a tiger's skin ('புலியின் தோல் போர்த்து'). It is trying to look fierce and powerful.",
      "Midground": "However, its true, weak nature is revealed by its action: it is peacefully and foolishly grazing on grass ('மேய்ந்து'). Its actions completely betray its fearsome appearance.",
      "Background": "This is presented as a direct and ridiculous simile for the impostor ascetic. This ascetic has the powerful outward appearance of a master ('வல் உருவம்'), but inwardly they lack the real strength and self-control to live up to it ('வலியில் நிலைமையான்')."

      "Lighting_and_Color": "A bright, clear, natural light that reveals the absurdity of the scene without any ambiguity. The colors of the tiger skin are vibrant, which makes the cow's placid grass-eating even more ridiculous.",

        "Camera": "A clear, direct shot that captures the full absurdity of the cow in the tiger skin, grazing peacefully.",
