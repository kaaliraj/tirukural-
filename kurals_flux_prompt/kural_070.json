      "Foreground": "A son is performing a great and noble deed—perhaps defending the innocent or demonstrating profound wisdom in a king's court. His actions are exemplary.",
      "Midground": "A crowd of people are watching the son. Instead of praising the son directly, their heads are turned towards the son's father, who stands humbly in the background.",
      "Background": "From the crowd, a single, powerful question, formed of glowing ethereal letters, rises and floats above the father: 'What great penance did this man perform to beget such a son?' ('என் நோற்றான் கொல்')."

      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The praise is indirect; the glory of the son is reflected back onto the father. The floating question is the literal manifestation of the son's 'repayment' to his father. The father's expression is not one of pride, but of humble, profound fulfillment.",
