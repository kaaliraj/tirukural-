      "Foreground": "A scholar is shown, possessing a vast amount of book-learning ('பலகற்றும்'). This is visualized by a huge stack of books and scrolls towering over them.",
      "Midground": "However, this scholar is shown completely out of sync with the world around them. The flow of society ('உலகத்தோடு') is a gentle, flowing river, but the scholar is trying to walk against it or stand awkwardly on the bank, unable to adapt ('ஒட்ட ஒழுகல்').",
      "Background": "Because of this inability to adapt their knowledge to the world, they are shown to be truly ignorant ('அறிவிலாதார்'). A dunce cap, representing folly, appears on their head despite the mountain of books they have learned. They are 'unlearned' ('கல்லார்') in the ways of the world."

      "Subject_and_Action": "Those who cannot adapt their conduct to be in harmony with the world are to be considered ignorant, no matter how much theoretical knowledge they have acquired.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The world as a river is a metaphor for the flow of society and custom. The scholar's inability to navigate this river, despite all their books, shows the uselessness of their knowledge in a practical sense. The dunce cap is a clear symbol of their true ignorance.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Ineffective, foolish, out of touch, ivory tower.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The river of the world is in natural, harmonious colors. The scholar and their books are in a slightly unnatural, out-of-place light. The dunce cap is stark and humiliating.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "A shot that contrasts the huge pile of the scholar's books with their clumsy and ineffective interaction with the 'river of the world'.",
        "Resolution": "8K, ultra-realistic, with a focus on the scholar's awkward and confused expression.",
        "Lighting": "Natural lighting for the world, and a slightly artificial, isolated light for the scholar.",
