      "Background": "One of them begins to speak ('வாய்ச் சொற்கள்'). However, the spoken words are shown to be unnecessary and meaningless. They are visualized as flimsy, insubstantial bubbles that simply float away and pop, having no purpose or effect ('என்ன பயனும் இல'). The communication of the eyes has already made them completely redundant."
