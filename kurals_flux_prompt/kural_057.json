      "Foreground": "A woman stands serene and free in an open, sunlit field. She is protected by her own powerful, internal aura of chastity ('நிறை'), which manifests as a beautiful but unbreakable dome of light around her.",
      "Midground": "In the distance, another woman is shown locked inside a formidable, dark, physical prison ('சிறை'). However, the bars of this prison are shown to be weak and easily broken from the outside, symbolizing the ineffectiveness of external guards.",
      "Background": "A bright, open sky for the virtuous woman, suggesting freedom. A dark, oppressive sky hangs over the physical prison, suggesting confinement is not a true protection."

      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The 'guard of chastity' ('நிறைகாக்கும் காப்பு') is a beautiful, self-generated field of light, not a confining wall. The physical prison ('சிறை காக்கும் காப்பு') is dark, oppressive, and ultimately ineffective. The contrast is between inner strength and external force.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Freedom in virtue vs. confinement in weakness; powerful, self-possessed, secure.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The virtuous woman is bathed in her own radiant light. The prison scene is dark, shadowy, and claustrophobic. The color palette contrasts vibrant, open freedom with dark, oppressive confinement.",
