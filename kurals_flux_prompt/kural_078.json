      "Foreground": "A single, dead, withered tree ('வற்றல் மரம்') stands in the middle of a vast, rocky desert or parched wasteland ('வன்பாற்கண்').",
      "Midground": "Miraculously, a few green leaves are attempting to sprout from its dead branches ('தளிர்த்தற்று'), but they are weak and unsustainable.",
      "Background": "The entire scene is a metaphor for the 'life of a soul without love' ('அன்பகத்தில்லா உயிர்வாழ்க்கை'). The outward appearance of life (the leaves) is a futile, unnatural struggle devoid of a true, internal source of nourishment (love)."

      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The contrast between the dead wood and the forced greenery is key. It should look wrong, a brief illusion of life that cannot last. The barrenness of the surrounding desert mirrors the inner barrenness of the loveless heart.",

      "Lighting_and_Color": "Harsh, unforgiving desert sunlight. The palette is dominated by the browns and greys of the dead tree and the parched earth. The few green leaves provide a stark, almost painful splash of color that highlights the scene's tragedy.",

        "Camera": "A lonely, wide shot, isolating the single tree in the vast, empty landscape to emphasize its solitude and hopelessness.",
