      "Foreground": "A powerful ascetic is shown enduring great hunger as part of his penance ('பசி ஆற்றல்'). His power is great, and he glows with the light of his discipline.",
      "Midground": "A simple householder is shown performing the act of charity, giving food to a hungry person and removing their hunger ('அப் பசியை மாற்றுவார்').",
      "Background": "A divine scale of power ('ஆற்றல்') appears. The great power of the ascetic is placed on one side. The simple act of the charitable man is placed on the other. The scale tips dramatically in favor of the man who gave the food. His power is shown to be superior, and the ascetic's power is secondary ('பின்')."
