      "Foreground": "A person is shown in a state of delusion ('மருள்'). They are surrounded by things that are not real ('பொருள் அல்லவற்றை')—illusions like mirages, phantoms, and dream-images.",
      "Midground": "Because of their delusion, they are perceiving these illusions as solid, real, and valuable things ('பொருள் என்று உணரும்'). They are trying to grasp the mist and build a house with shadows.",
      "Background": "This fundamental error in perception is shown to be the direct cause of their being trapped in a cycle of low, ignoble, and inglorious births ('மாணாப் பிறப்பு'). A dark, repeating carousel of miserable life-scenes is shown, powered by their delusion."
