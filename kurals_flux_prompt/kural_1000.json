      "Foreground": "A magnificent golden vessel, symbolizing great wealth ('Perunchelvam'), is filled to the brim with pure, white milk ('Nanpaal').",
      "Midground": "The vessel itself, however, is revealed to be made of a flawed, unclean material ('Panbilan'), perhaps unbaked clay or a tarnished, corrosive metal. Cracks and impurities are visible on its surface.",
      "Background": "As a result of the impure vessel, the pure milk inside is shown curdling, turning sour, and spoiling ('Thirinthattru'), becoming utterly useless. The scene takes place in a grand but decaying treasury."
