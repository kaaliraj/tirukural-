      "Foreground": "An ascetic is shown in the perfect, natural state of penance ('இயல்பாகும் நோன்பிற்கு'). This is a state of having absolutely nothing ('ஒன்று இன்மை'). They are free and unburdened.",
      "Midground": "Someone then offers them a single, simple possession ('உடைமை'), perhaps a beautiful new robe or a golden bowl.",
      "Background": "The moment the ascetic accepts this single possession, their clear, serene mind is instantly plunged back into a state of confusion and delusion ('மயல் ஆகும்'). The single object is shown to act like a seed from which a thorny, confusing thicket of new desires and attachments instantly grows, trapping them once more."
