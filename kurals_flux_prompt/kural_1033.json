      "Foreground": "A farmer and their family are shown eating a meal they have grown themselves ('உழுதுண்டு'). They are depicted as standing tall, free, and dignified. They are the ones who 'truly live' ('வாழ்வாரே வாழ்வார்').",
      "Midground": "Behind them, a long line of all other people in society ('மற்றெல்லாம்')—kings, priests, merchants—are shown.",
      "Background": "These other figures are depicted in a subservient posture, bowing respectfully ('தொழுது') to the farmer, and waiting to receive their food from the farmer's hands. They are followers, not leaders ('பின் செல்பவர்')."

      "Subject_and_Action": "A stark declaration of status: only farmers who live off their own tillage are truly living. All other professions are dependent followers who metaphorically worship the farmer to receive their food.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The posture is key. The farmer stands tall and independent. Everyone else, regardless of their worldly status, is in a posture of dependence and respect towards the farmer. The flow of food is one-way: from the farmer to everyone else.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Independent, dignified, foundational, superior.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "A strong, noble, and independent light shines on the farmer's family. The line of followers is in a slightly dimmer, more supplicant light. The palette emphasizes the farmer's connection to the earth and their fundamental power.",

        "Camera": "A shot that places the dignified farmer in the powerful foreground, with the long, bowing line of all other professions stretching out behind them.",
