      "Midground": "On either side of the path ('மருங்கு ஓடி'), treacherous, dark landscapes exist, tempting the walker to swerve. The person, however, does not commit any evil by deviating ('தீவினை செய்யான்').",
      "Background": "Because they stay on the path, they are surrounded by a powerful, invisible shield of protection. In the distance, a massive, dark storm representing Ruin or Destruction ('கேடு') is raging, but it is unable to touch the path or the person on it. They are known to be 'safe from ruin' ('அருங்கேடன்')."
