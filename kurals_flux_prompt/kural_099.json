      "Midground": "Despite this, in their left hand, they are holding a sharp, ugly, thorny rock, representing a 'harsh word' ('வன்சொல்'). They seem to be inexplicably choosing to offer the rock instead of the flower.",
      "Background": "The path to the right (associated with the flower) leads to a bright, happy landscape. The path to the left (associated with the rock) leads to a dark, sorrowful one. The person's illogical choice is the central mystery."
