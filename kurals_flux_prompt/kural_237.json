    "Tamil_Text": "புகழ்பட வாழாதார் தந்நோவார் தம்மைஇகழ்வாரை நோவது எவன்.",
    "English_Meaning": "Why do those who cannot live with praise, grieve those who despise them, instead of grieving themselves for their own inability."

    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A person who has failed to live a praiseworthy life ('புகழ்பட வாழாதார்') is shown.",
      "Midground": "A group of people are scorning and despising them ('இகழ்வார்'). The person is shown getting angry and blaming these scorners for their pain ('நோவது').",
      "Background": "A wise, spectral figure (perhaps Thiruvalluvar himself) appears and poses a question. The figure points the person's angry gaze away from the scorners and towards a mirror. In the mirror, the person sees that the true source of their failure is their own self. The image asks, 'Why blame them, when you should be blaming yourself?' ('தம் நோவார்')."

      "Subject_and_Action": "Those who fail to live a praiseworthy life should blame their own failings, not the people who rightly scorn them for it.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The mirror of self-reflection is the key. It redirects the blame from an external target to the correct, internal source. The anger at the scorners is shown to be a misguided waste of energy.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Introspective, self-blame, accountability, cautionary.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The scene is lit with a harsh, judgmental light. The act of blaming the scorners is a chaotic, angry red. The moment of self-realization in the mirror is a moment of cold, clear, difficult truth.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "A shot that follows the person's line of sight from the scorners to the mirror, forcing them (and the viewer) to confront the real source of the problem.",
