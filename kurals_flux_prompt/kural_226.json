      "Midground": "They are presented with two options. One is a strong, locked, but ultimately dead and sterile treasure vault. The other is the open, empty hands of the desperately hungry poor ('அற்றார் அழி பசி').",
      "Background": "The wise person makes the correct choice. They place their wealth into the hands of the poor. This act of charity ('தீர்த்தல்') is revealed to be the ultimate, most secure treasure house ('வைப் புழி'). As they place the gold in the hands of the poor, a divine, unbreakable vault of light forms around the act, showing it is the safest possible investment."
