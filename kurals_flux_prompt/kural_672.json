      "Foreground": "A split composition. On the left, a person is shown peacefully sleeping ('தூங்குக'). The task before them is something that requires time and patience, like a seed slowly growing into a plant. Delay is appropriate here.",
      "Midground": "On the right, the same person is shown wide-awake, alert, and acting with great speed and urgency ('தூங்கற்க'). The task before them is something that requires immediate action, like putting out a spreading fire.",
      "Background": "The background shows the two outcomes: on the left, the plant has grown perfectly due to the patient waiting. On the right, the fire is successfully extinguished due to the swift action."
