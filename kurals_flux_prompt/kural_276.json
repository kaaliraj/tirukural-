      "Foreground": "An impostor ascetic is shown. Outwardly, he has the appearance of one who has renounced the world ('துறந்தார் போல்').",
      "Midground": "A transparent, x-ray view of his heart ('நெஞ்சின்') reveals the truth. His heart is not at peace, but is a chaotic, grasping vortex of worldly desires. He has not renounced internally ('துறவார்').",
      "Background": "The image declares that there are 'no harder-hearted' or more cruel people ('வன்கணார் இல்') than these. For contrast, a simple, honest villain (like a robber) is shown in the background, and the impostor's inner corruption is depicted as being even darker and more profound."

      "Subject_and_Action": "There is no one more cruel and hard-hearted than the hypocrite who outwardly pretends to be a renunciant while inwardly clinging to all worldly desires.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The key is the contrast between the calm, holy exterior and the chaotic, desire-filled interior. The heart as a grasping vortex is a powerful metaphor for his un-renounced state. The comparison to an honest villain serves to elevate this hypocrisy as the greater evil.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Hypocritical, cruel, deceptive, ultimate hardness of heart.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The impostor's outer robes are lit with a soft, holy light. The inner view of his heart, however, is a dark, chaotic swirl of ugly, greedy colors. This creates a powerful and disturbing visual dissonance.",
