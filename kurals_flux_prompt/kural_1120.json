      "Background": "A surreal transformation occurs. To her impossibly soft feet, these softest of objects feel as harsh and painful as the sharp, thorny fruit of the Nerunji plant ('நெருஞ்சிப் பழம்'). The flower and feather are shown leaving sharp, painful impressions on her skin as if they were covered in spikes."
