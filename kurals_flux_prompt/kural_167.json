      "Foreground": "An envious man ('అழுக்காறு உடையான்') is shown in his prosperous home. The Goddess Lakshmi ('செய்யவள்'), the embodiment of fortune, is present with him, but she is looking at his envious nature with disapproval and disgust.",
      "Midground": "Deciding she cannot stay, Lakshmi is shown turning her back and walking towards the door to depart. As she does, she points behind her.",
      "Background": "At the door, waiting to enter as Lakshmi leaves, is her elder sister, the Goddess Mudevi ('తవ్వై'), the embodiment of misfortune and squalor. Lakshmi is not just leaving; she is actively pointing the way for her sister, Misfortune, to come in and take her place."
