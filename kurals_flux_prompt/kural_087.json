      "Foreground": "A host is offering simple food to a guest who appears to be a humble traveler.",
      "Midground": "As the host performs the act of giving, a magnificent, invisible, cosmic scale materializes. On one side is the simple act of hospitality. On the other side, the 'worth' of the guest ('விருந்தின் துணைத்துணை') determines the result.",
      "Background": "The humble guest is revealed to have a brilliant, divine aura, showing they are a great sage or a god in disguise. Because of the guest's immense worth, the cosmic scale tips dramatically, showing that the fruit of the host's hospitality ('வேள்விப் பயன்') is immeasurably vast and cannot be calculated by the simple value of the food given."
