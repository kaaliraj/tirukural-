      "Foreground": "A group of people are trying to build a great structure, but they are using a fundamentally flawed method ('ஆற்றின் வருந்தா வருத்தம்')—perhaps trying to build the roof before the foundation.",
      "Midground": "A huge crowd of supporters ('பலர் நின்று போற்றினும்') is cheering them on, offering encouragement and trying to physically hold up the collapsing structure.",
      "Background": "Despite all the support and effort, the structure is inevitably and catastrophically failing and turning to dust ('பொத்துப் படும்'). The flawed method guarantees failure, regardless of the amount of support."

      "Subject_and_Action": "An undertaking based on an incorrect method will fail, even if it has the support of a multitude.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The flaw in the method should be visually obvious to the viewer (e.g., building from the top down). The futility of the supporters' efforts—trying to hold up a collapsing building with their bare hands—emphasizes that support cannot fix a flawed plan.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Inevitable failure, futile, flawed, cautionary.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "A chaotic, dusty light fills the scene. The palette is one of confusion and collapse, with browns and greys of dust and rubble.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "A wide, chaotic shot that captures the flawed construction, the useless support of the crowd, and the inevitable collapse in a single frame.",
        "Resolution": "8K, hyper-realistic, with advanced physics simulation for the collapsing structure.",
        "Lighting": "Chaotic, dusty, and dramatic lighting to convey the sense of failure.",
