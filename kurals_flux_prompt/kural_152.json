      "Foreground": "A person is shown being wronged by another. In an act of 'forbearance' ('பொறுத்தல்'), they are shown placing a heavy, dark stone representing the trespass on the ground beside them, choosing not to throw it back.",
      "Midground": "In a subsequent action, representing a higher virtue, the same person touches the dark stone of memory. The moment they touch it with the intent to 'forget' ('மறத்தல்'), it dissolves into a puff of smoke and vanishes completely.",
      "Background": "The background is a serene landscape. Once the stone of trespass is gone, the landscape becomes brighter and a path forward becomes clear, showing that forgetting brings greater peace than merely tolerating."

      "Subject_and_Action": "A visual hierarchy of virtue: forbearing a trespass is good, but completely forgetting it is even better and more liberating.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The trespass as a heavy, dark stone is a clear metaphor. Forbearing is putting the stone down. Forgetting is making it cease to exist. The visual difference between these two actions is key.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Liberating, forgiving, serene, progressing from good to better.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The scene is lit with a calm, gentle light. The stone is dark and ugly. When it dissolves, it releases a small puff of dark smoke, which is quickly replaced by brighter, cleaner light.",
