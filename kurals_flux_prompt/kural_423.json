      "Foreground": "A wise person sits in a meditative posture at the center of a convergence of streams.",
      "Midground": "Various streams of information flow towards them from all directions, each stream representing different speakers ('யார்யார்வாய்') and different subjects ('எப்பொருள்'). The streams are murky and contain a mixture of silt (falsehood) and glowing golden particles (truth).",
      "Background": "As the murky streams reach the wise person, their mind acts as a filter. The silt and mud are discarded, and only the pure, glowing golden particles of truth ('மெய்ப்பொருள்') are absorbed, forming a radiant aura of pure wisdom ('அறிவு') around them."
