      "Foreground": "A person is shown speaking words that are without profit and without character ('பயன் சாராப் பண்பில் சொல்') in a large assembly.",
      "Midground": "The person is standing on a beautiful, green path of 'Goodness' or 'Virtue' ('நன்மை', 'நயன்').",
      "Background": "The useless words they speak are visualized as a powerful, unnatural wind that blows directly out of their own mouth.
