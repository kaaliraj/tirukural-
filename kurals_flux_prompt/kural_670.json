      "Midground": "However, this otherwise perfect statue is shown to be completely passive. It lacks the desire to act. Before it lies a task to be done, but the statue makes no move to do it, lacking 'firmness in action' ('வினைத்திட்பம் வேண்டார்').",
      "Background": "The World, personified by a crowd of people, is shown looking at this magnificent but passive statue. Their expression is not one of admiration, but of disappointment and disregard. They are turning their backs and walking away, not desiring the one who will not act ('வேண்டாது உலகு')."
