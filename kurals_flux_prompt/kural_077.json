    "Tamil_Text": "என்பி லதனை வெயில்போலக் காயுமேஅன்பி லதனை அறம்.",
    "English_Meaning": "Virtue will burn up the soul which is without love, even as the sun burns up the creature which is without bone, ie worms."

    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A harsh, barren landscape under a blazing sun ('வெயில்'). On the cracked earth, tiny, boneless creatures like worms ('என்பிலதனை') are shown withering and drying up under the intense heat.",
      "Midground": "In a parallel metaphysical space, a human figure who is 'loveless' ('அன்பிலதனை') is shown. They are not being burned by a sun, but by a pure, intense, white light of Virtue ('அறம்'). This light is causing their form to wither and fade away.",
      "Background": "The source of the light of Virtue is a vast, radiant, celestial sun, establishing a direct parallel with the physical sun that burns the worms."

    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "A powerful simile: Just as the physical sun scorches and destroys boneless creatures, the spiritual law of Virtue scorches and destroys souls that lack the 'backbone' of Love.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The loveless soul is depicted as weak and insubstantial, much like a worm. The light of Virtue is not portrayed as evil or punishing, but as a pure, natural force whose intensity cannot be borne by those without the essential structure of Love.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Harsh reality, inevitable consequence, natural law, intense.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The physical scene is dominated by the harsh, yellow-white light of the sun. The metaphysical scene is dominated by the pure, piercing, white light of Virtue. Both convey an intense, unbearable heat.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "Split-screen or juxtaposed composition to make the simile immediate and clear.",
        "Resolution": "8K, hyper-realistic, with detailed textures of the sun-baked earth and the withering forms.",
        "Lighting": "Intense, overexposed, glaring light effects to convey the scorching power of both the sun and virtue.",
        "Art_Genre": "Surrealist allegorical painting."
