      "Foreground": "An unlearned but naturally clever person ('கல்லாதான்') offers a rough, uncut diamond ('ஒட்பம்') to a group of wise gemologists ('அறிவுடையார்').",
      "Midground": "The gemologists examine the diamond. While acknowledging its raw potential, they gently refuse it, pointing instead to a perfectly cut, multi-faceted, and brilliantly shining diamond on a nearby pedestal, which represents true, refined knowledge.",
      "Background": "A workshop filled with tools for cutting and polishing gems, symbolizing the process of formal learning and refinement that turns raw intelligence into true wisdom."
