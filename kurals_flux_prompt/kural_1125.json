      "Foreground": "A lover's mind is visualized as a landscape.",
      "Midground": "In this mind-scape, the memory of his beloved, who has shining, warlike eyes ('ஒள் அமர்க் கண்ணாள்'), is not a fleeting image. It is a permanent, radiant, eternal sun that never sets.",
      "Background": "Because this sun of her memory never sets, the concept of 'forgetting' ('மறப்பு') is an impossibility, like trying to find darkness at noon. Therefore, the act of 'remembering' or 'recalling' ('உள்ளுவன்') is also meaningless, as one can only recall what has first been forgotten. He is in a state of constant, unbroken remembrance."
