      "Foreground": "A powerful, determined individual is shown. They are turning their back on a beautiful, tempting garden of worldly pleasures ('இன்பம் விழையான்') and are instead facing a difficult but noble task, like building a dam or a fortress ('வினை விழைவான்').",
      "Midground": "As they work, they transform into a massive, strong, stone pillar ('தூண்').",
      "Background": "This pillar is shown to be the central support for the homes and lives of all their kinsfolk ('தன் கேளிர்'). The pillar is actively wiping away their sorrows, represented by it holding back a dark flood of 'misery' ('துன்பம் துடைத்து') that would otherwise engulf their community."

      "Subject_and_Action": "The person who chooses noble work over personal pleasure becomes the very pillar that supports their family and community, protecting them from sorrow.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The transformation from person to pillar is the key visual metaphor. The choice to turn away from pleasure is shown as the source of this strength. The pillar's dual function—supporting the community and holding back the flood of sorrow—is crucial.",
