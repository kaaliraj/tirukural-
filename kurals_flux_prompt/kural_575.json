      "Midground": "On the left side, the eye is adorned with a beautiful, glowing light of kindness ('கண்ணோட்டம்'). This light is its true ornament ('அணிகலம்'). On the right side, the eye lacks this light of kindness ('அஃதின்றேல்'). As a result, it is not just plain, but is depicted as a painful, ugly wound or sore ('புண்').",
