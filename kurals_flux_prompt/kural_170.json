      "Midground": "On the left, an envious person is shown trying to climb a mountain towards a peak representing 'Greatness'. However, their envy is a heavy, dark chain that forever keeps them shackled to the bottom. It is an absolute rule: 'the envious never become great' ('అழுக்கற்று அகன்றாரும் இல்லை').",
      "Background": "On the right, a person free from envy is shown. They may be starting from a humble position, but because they are unburdened by the chain of envy, a path of light naturally leads them upwards towards a state of prosperity and greatness ('பெருக்கத்தில் தீர்ந்தாரும் இல்'). Their rise is gentle but certain."
