      "Foreground": "A base person ('கீழ்') is shown with a normal, sullen expression.",
      "Midground": "They then witness another person committing a vile and wicked act ('அகப்பட்டி ஆவாரைக் காணின்').",
      "Background": "Upon seeing someone even more wicked than themselves, the base person's demeanor instantly changes. They puff out their chest, a smug and superior smile spreading across their face. They feel a sense of pride and greatness by comparison ('மிகப் பட்டுச் செம்மாக்கும்')."
    },
    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "The perverse nature of the base is that their sense of pride and self-esteem comes not from their own good deeds, but from witnessing the even greater wickedness of others.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The sudden transformation in the base person's posture and expression is the key narrative element. Their pride is based on a downward comparison, not an upward aspiration. The other wicked person acts as a mirror that reflects a distorted, flattering image back at them.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Perverse, smug, comparative evil, proud of wickedness.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "A dim, sordid light illuminates the scene. When the base person feels their perverse pride, a sickly, false glow of self-satisfaction might briefly appear around them.",

        "Camera": "A close-up on the base person's face, capturing their subtle but significant shift in expression from sullenness to smug pride.",
