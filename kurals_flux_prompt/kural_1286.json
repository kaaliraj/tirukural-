      "Midground": "On the left, she is in his presence ('காணுங்கால்'). He is bathed in a golden, adoring light, and any potential faults he has are completely invisible. She sees no fault at all ('காணேன் தவறாய').",
      "Background": "On the right, he is absent ('காணாக்கால்'). She is thinking of him, but now her perception is completely different. Her mind conjures an image of him that is covered in dark, ugly faults. In his absence, she can see nothing BUT his faults ('காணேன் தவறல்லவை')."
