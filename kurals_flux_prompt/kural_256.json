      "Midground": "On one side, a consumer ('உலகு') is shown firmly refusing to buy or eat meat for the sake of consumption ('தினல் பொருட்டால்'). Because of this refusal, there is no demand.",
      "Background": "On the other side, a butcher or hunter is shown. Because there is no demand, they are shown putting down their tools and ceasing their work. There is 'no one who would sell flesh for profit' ('விலைப் பொருட்டால் ஊன் தருவார் இல்'), because no one is buying."
