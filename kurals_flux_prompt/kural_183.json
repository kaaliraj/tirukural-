    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A split composition showing two alternate fates for a backbiter.",
      "Midground": "On the left, the backbiter is shown living their life of hypocrisy ('புறங்கூறிப் பொய்த்து உயிர் வாழ்தல்'). This life is depicted as a miserable, shadowy, and dishonorable existence, a true living death.",
      "Background": "On the right, the alternative fate of 'death' ('சாதல்') is shown. This is not a gruesome end, but a peaceful release. From this death, a luminous path opens up towards a realm of virtue and goodness, representing the 'profit pointed out by virtue' ('அறம் கூறும் ஆக்கம்')."

      "Subject_and_Action": "For a backbiting hypocrite, death is a far more profitable and virtuous outcome than continuing to live such a life.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The contrast is between a shameful, living death and a potentially redeeming, actual death. The path to virtue opening up *after* death is the key, suggesting that only by ceasing their sinful life can they find a path to goodness.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Paradoxical, redeeming death, cautionary.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The life of hypocrisy is in dark, murky, ugly colors. The scene of death is calm and neutral, but the path of virtue that opens from it is brilliant, pure, and golden.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "A diptych that presents the two fates, framing death as the more honorable and profitable choice.",
        "Resolution": "8K, ultra-realistic, with ethereal effects for the path of virtue.",
