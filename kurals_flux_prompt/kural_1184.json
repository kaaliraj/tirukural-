      "Foreground": "A woman is shown. Her mind ('உள்ளுவன்') and her speech ('உரைப்பது') are visualized.",
      "Midground": "Her mind is filled with nothing but constant, loving thoughts of her beloved. Her speech is a stream of words that only praise his good qualities ('அவர் திறம்'). Both her thoughts and words are depicted as pure, golden light.",
      "Background": "Despite this absolute loyalty in thought and word, her skin is covered in the sickly pallor of lovesickness ('பசப்பு'). This pallor is depicted as a treacherous, deceitful entity ('கள்ளம்'), acting in complete contradiction to her steadfast mind and heart. It is a betrayal by her own body."

    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "The woman laments the deceitful nature of her own physical pallor, which seems to betray her by appearing even while her mind and words remain completely loyal to her beloved.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The contrast between the golden light of her loyal thoughts/words and the sickly green of the pallor on her skin is the central visual. The pallor is a separate, almost alien thing that is acting against her will, hence it is a 'deceiver'.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Betrayed by one's own body, contradictory, loyal mind vs. treacherous body.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "A warm, golden light illuminates the woman's mind and speech. However, her body is overlaid with a sickly, pale green-yellow light that does not belong. The two light sources are in conflict.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "A symbolic portrait that uses transparent overlays to show the woman's inner thoughts, her words, and the contradictory state of her physical body.",
