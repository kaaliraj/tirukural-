      "Foreground": "A person with a bright, genuinely smiling face ('முகன் அமர்ந்து') is speaking a kind, pleasant word ('இன்சொலன்') to a weary traveler.",
      "Midground": "The spoken word manifests as a warm, comforting blanket of golden light that envelops the traveler, bringing them more visible joy and relief than any physical gift.",
      "Background": "In the background, another scene is depicted in a slightly faded manner for comparison: a person gives a large bag of gold ('ஈதல்') with a joyous heart ('அகன் அமர்ந்து'), but their face is neutral. The recipient of the gold looks pleased, but not as deeply comforted as the traveler receiving the kind word."
