      "Midground": "On the left, a person is practicing good conduct ('ஒழுக்கம் உடைமை'). This act causes them to be spiritually elevated, and they are shown standing on a noble pedestal, crowned with a light that signifies true nobility of birth ('குடிமை').",
      "Background": "On the right, a person is practicing bad conduct ('இழுக்கம்'). This act causes them to be spiritually degraded. The ground beneath them crumbles, and they sink down into a lower, meaner state, signifying a 'base birth' ('இழிந்த பிறப்பு')."

      "Subject_and_Action": "True nobility is defined by one's conduct, not by one's parentage. Good conduct elevates you to a high birth, while bad conduct degrades you to a low one.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The upward movement (elevation to nobility) versus the downward movement (sinking into baseness) is the key visual metaphor. The state of 'birth' is shown not as a starting point, but as a direct and immediate consequence of one's own actions.",
