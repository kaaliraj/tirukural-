      "Foreground": "A man has an outward appearance of holiness that is as lofty as heaven itself ('வான் உயர் தோற்றம்'). He is depicted as a giant, majestic figure, glowing with a holy light, revered by the masses below.",
      "Midground": "However, a transparent view into his mind ('தன் நெஞ்சம்') reveals a dark secret. His conscience knows that he is guilty of a secret sin ('தான் அறி குற்றம்').",
      "Background": "This inner knowledge of his own guilt acts as a powerful corrosive force. It is shown eating away at the foundation of his majestic, heaven-high appearance, causing it to crack and crumble from within. The image asks, 'Of what use is that appearance?' ('எவன் செய்யும்?')."

      "Subject_and_Action": "What is the use of a heaven-high reputation for sanctity if your own conscience knows you are guilty? That inner guilt will inevitably destroy the outer appearance.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The contrast between the magnificent outer shell and the corrupting inner core is the key. The conscious guilt is an active, destructive agent, not a passive feeling. The crumbling of the majestic form from the inside out shows the power of a guilty conscience.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Corrupt, self-destructive, hollow, inevitable collapse.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The outer appearance is a brilliant, but brittle, white-gold light. The inner guilt is a dark, acidic, black-green corruption that spreads cracks of darkness throughout the magnificent form.",
