      "Midground": "The other face is that of a stern judge, pointing decisively to remove a criminal element, represented by a shadowy figure, from the society ('குற்றம் கடிதல்').",
      "Background": "This act of removing crime is shown not as a blemish or a fault ('வடுவன்று'), but as a necessary and professional duty ('வேந்தன் தொழில்'), like a gardener skillfully weeding a beautiful garden to allow the good plants to thrive."
