      "Foreground": "A split composition illustrating an inevitable consequence.",
      "Midground": "On the left, a foolish and angry person is shown striking the hard, stone ground with their bare fist ('நிலத்து அறைந்தான் கை'). The immediate, certain result is shown: their hand is broken and bleeding. The result is inescapable ('பிழையாது').",
      "Background": "On the right, a person is shown cherishing their anger as a valuable and useful thing ('சினத்தைப் பொருள் என்று கொண்டவன்'). In the same way, their own ruin and destruction ('கேடு') is shown as the immediate, certain, and inescapable consequence of this foolish belief."
