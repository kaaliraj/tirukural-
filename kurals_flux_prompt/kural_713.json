      "Foreground": "A foolish speaker is shown barging into a council of solemn, scholarly sages ('அவை அறியார்'). They are speaking loudly and inappropriately.",
      "Midground": "Their words ('சொல்லல்') are visualized as crude, mismatched building blocks—like throwing rough stones into a delicate watch mechanism. They demonstrate a complete ignorance of the 'types of words' ('சொல்லின் வகை அறியார்').",
      "Background": "A vision of the speaker's own mind shows that their learning, which should be a source of power, is a chaotic, disorganized mess. They have no real mastery over what they know ('வல்லதூஉம் இல்'). Their speech is a direct reflection of their internal chaos."

      "Lighting_and_Color": "The council of sages is in a calm, intellectual, low light. The foolish speaker and their crude words burst in with a harsh, glaring, and unwelcome light, disrupting the harmony of the scene.",

        "Camera": "A shot that frames the foolish speaker as an intruder, disrupting the established order of the wise council.",
