      "Foreground": "A lover is shown at a moment of decision. Their body ('உடம்பு') and soul ('உயிர்') are depicted as suffering, unable to bear the pain of love ('நோனா').",
      "Midground": "They are performing a decisive act: a spectral, shimmering cloak representing 'Shame' or 'Reserve' ('நாண்') is being forcefully cast off and pushed aside ('நீக்கி நிறுத்து').",
      "Background": "Having cast off shame, the now resolute figure is seen mounting the painful Palmyra Horse ('மடல் ஏறும்'). This act, though it abandons social grace, is framed as the only way to save their body and soul from the unbearable pain."

      "Subject_and_Action": "The unbearable agony of both body and soul forces the lover to make a conscious choice to abandon their natural sense of shame in order to mount the Madal and seek resolution.",
