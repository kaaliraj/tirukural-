      "Midground": "Priests and devotees are seen turning away from the temple, their expressions downcast, unable to perform their duties ('பூசனை செல்லாது').",
      "Background": "A relentlessly dry, cloudless sky ('வானம் வறக்குமேல்') looms over the temple. Ethereal figures of celestial beings ('வானோர்') are faintly visible in the sky, looking down with concern as the link of worship between them and the earth is broken."
