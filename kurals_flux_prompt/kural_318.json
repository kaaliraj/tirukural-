      "Midground": "In a ghostly, superimposed vision, the person is shown simultaneously experiencing the exact same harm themselves. They are both the perpetrator and the victim of the same act.",
      "Background": "A wise, spectral observer (Thiruvalluvar) points to this paradox, and a question materializes in the air: 'He knows for himself how painful this is ('தன்னுயிர்க்கு இன்னாமை தான் அறிவான்'), so why on earth does he do it to another?' ('என் கொலோ?')."
