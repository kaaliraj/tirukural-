    "Tamil_Text": "வேலொடு நின்றான் இடுவென் றதுபோலுங் கோலொடு நின்றான் இரவு.",
    "English_Meaning": "The request (for money) of him who holds the sceptre is like the word of a highway robber who stands with a weapon in hand and says 'give up your wealth'."

      "Foreground": "A split-screen image showing two almost identical scenes.",
      "Midground": "On the left, a masked highway robber stands with a spear ('வேலொடு நின்றான்'), aggressively demanding money from a terrified traveler with the word 'Give!' ('இடு'). On the right, a tyrant king stands with his royal sceptre ('கோலொடு நின்றான்'), 'requesting' taxes from a terrified citizen. The king's posture and expression are just as menacing as the robber's.",
      "Background": "The visual parallel is made explicit: the sceptre is held like a weapon, the 'request' is a demand, and the citizen's fear is identical to the traveler's. The two acts are shown to be morally equivalent."

      "Subject_and_Action": "A tyrant's demand for taxes under the authority of his sceptre is no different from a highwayman's demand for money at spear-point.",

      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Menacing, intimidating, unjust, extortionate.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "Both scenes are lit with a harsh, dramatic, and threatening light. The color palette is dark and oppressive, emphasizing the fear of the victims.",
