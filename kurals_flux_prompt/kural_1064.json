      "Foreground": "A person is shown in a state of absolute destitution, with no place to even stand ('இடம் இல்லாக்கால்'). They are hungry and have nothing.",
      "Midground": "Despite this, they stand with immense, unbreakable dignity, refusing to beg ('இரவு ஒல்லாச் சால்பு').",
      "Background": "The entire world ('இடம் எல்லாம்'), personified by all the kings, sages, and peoples of the Earth, is shown trying to build a monument tall enough to honor this person's dignity. But no matter how high they build, their monument is not great enough to match the stature of this person's noble refusal ('கொள்ளாத் தகைத்து')."

      "Subject_and_Action": "The noble perfection of a person who refuses to beg even in the most extreme poverty is a virtue so great that the entire world, with all its space and resources, is not large enough to contain its praise.",

      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Supreme dignity, immeasurable virtue, noble, transcendent.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The destitute person glows with a brilliant, inner light of their own dignity, which makes their poverty irrelevant. The world's monument, though vast, is shown to be a lesser, mundane structure compared to the person's spiritual greatness.",
