      "Foreground": "A ruler is shown cowering on his throne, radiating an aura of incompetence. He is an easy target for his enemies ('தஞ்சம் எளியன் பகைக்கு').",
      "Midground": "His four fatal flaws are visualized around him as spectral chains that bind him. A shadowy chain of Fear ('அஞ்சும்'). A dark chain of Ignorance ('அறியான்'), perhaps blinding his eyes. A chaotic chain of Unsociability ('அமைவிலன்'), pushing people away. A grasping, tight chain of Niggardliness ('ஈகலான்'), closing his hands.",
      "Background": "Enemy soldiers are shown laughing as they approach, seeing how utterly helpless and vulnerable this ruler has made himself through his own character flaws."
    },
    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "A ruler who is defined by cowardice, ignorance, unsociability, and miserliness becomes an laughably easy and vulnerable target for any enemy.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The four character flaws as magical, binding chains is the central metaphor. Each chain has a design that reflects the flaw it represents. The enemies' laughter emphasizes the ruler's pathetic state, not his tragedy.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Pathetic, vulnerable, incompetent, self-defeating.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "A dim, unflattering light illuminates the pathetic ruler. The spectral chains glow with sickly, corrupt colors—fearful grey, ignorant black, chaotic red, and miserly green. The approaching enemies are in strong, confident colors.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "A low-angle shot that looks up at the approaching enemies, making them seem powerful, while the ruler on the throne appears small and pathetic despite his high seat.",
        "Resolution": "8K, ultra-realistic, with ethereal effects for the binding chains.",
        "Lighting": "The ruler is trapped in the dim light of his own flaws, while the enemies advance in a confident light.",
        "Art_Genre": "Dark fantasy, political satire."
