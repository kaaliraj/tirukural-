      "Midground": "Another ascetic is shown. His primary motivation is different: he is shown meticulously planning his every move—how he walks, how he breathes—out of a deep-seated fear of the guilt of killing any living thing ('கொலை அஞ்சி').",
      "Background": "A divine light shines down from the heavens, and a celestial crown is bestowed not on the first ascetic, but on the second. The one whose life is governed by the principle of absolute non-violence ('கொல்லாமை சூழ்வான்') is declared the 'chief' ('தலை') of all renunciants."
