      "Foreground": "A split-screen composition. On the left, a figure is depicted in a state of destructive, fiery rage ('இறந்த வெகுளி'). The scene is chaotic and damaging.",
      "Midground": "On the right, a figure is depicted in a state of ecstatic joy and celebration ('சிறந்த உவகை'). However, this joy leads to carelessness ('சோர்வு'). They are so intoxicated with happiness that they are unknowingly dropping a glowing orb of 'Responsibility' into a dark pit.",
      "Background": "The damage from the anger on the left is visible and immediate. The damage from the joyful carelessness on the right is more subtle but depicted as far more catastrophic—the dark pit is shown to be bottomless, signifying a greater and more permanent loss."
