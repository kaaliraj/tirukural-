      "Foreground": "A person is shown in a profound act of spiritual realization. They are understanding the 'Ultimate Support' of the universe, God ('சார்பு உணர்ந்து'). This is visualized as them being connected by a single, powerful thread of light to a great, cosmic sun.",
      "Midground": "As they realize this one true support, they are shown letting go of all their other, lesser supports and attachments ('சார்பு கெட ஒழுகின்'). These lesser supports, like wealth and relationships, are depicted as flimsy, rotten ropes that fall away.",
      "Background": "A host of menacing, disease-like, spiritual afflictions ('சார்தரு நோய்') that were clinging to the lesser ropes are shown trying to reach the person. However, now that the person has let go of the lesser ropes, these afflictions have nothing to hold on to. They are unable to attach themselves ('சார்தரா') and are destroyed ('அழித்து'), falling away into nothingness."

      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Liberation, purification, secure, unburdened.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The cosmic sun of the True Support is the source of all light, a brilliant, pure gold. The lesser ropes of attachment are dark and decaying. The afflictions are sickly, disease-like creatures of shadow.",

        "Camera": "A shot that shows the person letting go of the dark ropes, the afflictions falling away as a result, and the single, strong thread of light to the True Support remaining as their only connection.",
        "Resolution": "8K, ultra-realistic, with strong symbolic effects for the ropes, the thread, and the afflictions.",
        "Lighting": "The light from the cosmic sun should be shown purifying the scene as the lesser attachments are renounced.",
