      "Midground": "However, a transparent view into the courtesan's mind reveals her true motive. Her heart is not filled with love ('அன்பின் விழையார்'), but is a dark, grasping void fixated on the man's purse of gold ('பொருள் விழையும்').",
      "Background": "The beautiful golden flowers of her speech, once they have served their purpose of charming the man, are shown to transform mid-air into a treacherous, thorny vine that ensnares the man, pulling him down into a pit of disgrace and sorrow ('இழுக்குத் தரும்')."
