      "Background": "With a single, powerful sweep of their sword, the wise person is shown not attacking the kings themselves, but utterly destroying their very 'names' ('நாமம் கெட'). As the names on the thrones shatter, the three great kings and their entire dark kingdom, which represents all the sorrows and afflictions of life ('நோய்'), instantly crumble into dust and vanish ('கெடும்')."
