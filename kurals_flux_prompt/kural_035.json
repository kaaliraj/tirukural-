    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A serene figure walks steadfastly along a straight, luminous path representing Virtue ('அறம்').",
      "Midground": "Four monstrous, shadowy beasts try to attack the path. Each beast represents one of the four vices: a green-eyed serpent for Malice ('அழுக்காறு'), a grasping, many-armed creature for Desire ('அவா'), a raging, fiery beast for Anger ('வெகுளி'), and a creature with a sharp, thorny tongue for Bitter Speech ('இன்னாச்சொல்').",
      "Background": "The path of Virtue is unshakable. As the beasts touch the edge of the path's light, they recoil and partly dematerialize, unable to corrupt or halt the walker's progress."

      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The path is made of solid, unblemished white stone, symbolizing purity and steadfastness. The walker on the path does not fight the beasts but simply proceeds, their commitment to the path ('இழுக்கா இயன்றது') being their only defense, which is shown to be absolute.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Steadfast, pure, unassailable, serene in the face of corruption.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The path of Virtue radiates a pure, white-gold light. The surrounding area is dark and chaotic, colored with sickly greens, greedy oranges, fiery reds, and harsh purples associated with the four beasts.",
