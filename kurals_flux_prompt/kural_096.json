      "Midground": "This stream of light has a dual effect. On one side, it flows over a patch of dark, thorny weeds representing 'vices' ('அல்லவை'), causing them to wither and fade away ('தேய'). On the other side, it flows over a small, tender sapling representing 'virtue' ('அறம்'), causing it to grow rapidly and flourish ('பெருகும்').",
