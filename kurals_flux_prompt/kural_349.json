      "Foreground": "A person is shown in the very moment of letting go of their final attachment. The attachment is a golden chain ('பற்று') connecting them to the world.",
      "Midground": "The very instant ('கண்ணே') the chain is broken ('அற்ற'), a great, dark, thorny vine representing the cycle of future births ('பிறப்பு') is shown being severed at its root ('அறுக்கும்'). The link to reincarnation is cut.",
      "Background": "In contrast, a vision of the alternative is shown: if the chain of attachment is not broken, the world is revealed to be a chaotic, flickering, and unstable illusion ('நிலையாமை காணப்படும்'). True stability is only found at the moment of detachment."

      "Subject_and_Action": "The severing of the cycle of birth happens at the very instant of complete detachment. As long as attachment remains, all that can be perceived is instability.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The chain of attachment and the vine of rebirth are linked; breaking the first instantly severs the second. The contrast between the decisive act of cutting and the blurry, unstable world of attachment is key.",

      "Lighting_and_Color": "The act of breaking the chain releases a brilliant flash of pure, white light, which is the light that severs the vine of rebirth. The world of attachment is a flickering, unstable, grey illusion.",

        "Camera": "A high-speed, slow-motion shot that captures the exact instant the chain breaks and the vine of rebirth is severed.",
