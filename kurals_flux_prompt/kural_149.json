      "Foreground": "A man stands on a shore, looking out at the vast, terrifying, and dangerous ocean, which represents the world ('நாமநீர் வைப்பு').",
      "Midground": "He is shown making a conscious choice: he refuses to touch the shoulder of another's wife ('பிறர்க்கு உரியாள் தோள் தோயாதார்'). This act of refusal is visualized as him building a small, safe, and unsinkable boat around himself.",
      "Background": "Because he has built this boat of virtue, he is shown to be the one who is truly 'entitled to all good' ('நலக்குரியார்'). While others are struggling in the terrifying ocean of the world, he is safe and prosperous in his boat, able to navigate the dangers with ease."
