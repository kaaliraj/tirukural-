      "Foreground": "The pallor of lovesickness ('பசப்பு') is personified as a predatory, shadowy beast, hiding in the corners of a room.",
      "Midground": "A husband and wife are shown in a close embrace ('கொண்கன் முயக்கு'). The embrace creates a warm, protective circle of light around them.",
      "Background": "The beast of pallor is shown keenly watching and waiting ('பார்க்கும்'). The moment there is the slightest gap or separation in the embrace ('முயக்கு அற்றம்'), the beast instantly leaps into that gap to attack the woman, just as darkness ('இருள்') instantly floods a room the moment a lamp ('விளக்கு') is extinguished."

      "Subject_and_Action": "A powerful simile: the pallor of lovesickness is like a predatory darkness, constantly waiting for the slightest cessation of the lover's embrace to attack.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The personification of pallor as a waiting predator is the key. The embrace as a protective circle of light that keeps the predator at bay is a strong counter-image. The speed of the attack upon the slightest separation emphasizes its ever-present threat.",
