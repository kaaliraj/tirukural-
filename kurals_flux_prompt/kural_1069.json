      "Midground": "On the left, the person is merely thinking about the act of having to beg ('இரவு உள்ள'). In response to this thought, their heart is visualized as made of wax, which begins to gently melt with shame and sorrow ('உள்ளம் உருகும்').",
      "Background": "On the right, the person is now thinking about the possibility of being refused ('கரவு உள்ள'). At this thought, their melting heart instantly shatters into a thousand pieces, as if made of brittle glass. It is not just melted, but completely destroyed ('இன்றிக் கெடும்')."
