      "Foreground": "An ascetic, who has renounced all worldly desires ('விழைவதூஉம் விட்டேம் என்பார்'), is sitting in deep meditation under a tree.",
      "Midground": "In the background, a farmer is shown. His hands, which were once working, are now idle and folded ('உழவினார் கைம்மடங்கின்'). The fields behind him are barren.",
      "Background": "Because the farmer has stopped working, the ascetic's own state is shown to be failing. He is growing weak from lack of food, and his meditation is disturbed. His noble state of renunciation ('நிலை') is proving to be unsustainable ('இல்லை') without the foundational labor of the farmer."

      "Subject_and_Action": "If farmers stop working, even the most otherworldly ascetics who claim to have renounced everything will find their own state unsustainable.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The direct causal link between the farmer's inaction and the ascetic's failure is the key. The ascetic's spiritual life is shown to be dependent on the material labor of the farmer. Even the highest state of being rests on the foundation of agriculture.",
