      "Foreground": "A person with no inner sense of shame ('Naan Agaththillar') is shown interacting in a social setting. However, they are depicted as a wooden puppet ('Marappaavai').",
      "Midground": "Visible, ethereal strings ('Naanaal') are attached to the puppet's limbs, leading upwards. These strings are being manipulated by unseen hands, making the puppet perform life-like but ultimately hollow and meaningless actions ('Iyakkam').",
      "Background": "A crowd of normal, flesh-and-blood people are interacting genuinely around the puppet, highlighting its artificial and lifeless nature by contrast."
