      "Foreground": "A woman is shown, her skin pale with the sallow hue of lovesickness.",
      "Midground": "A group of townspeople are pointing at her and whispering. Their words are visualized: 'She has turned sallow!' ('பசந்தாள் இவள்'). They are blaming her, judging her physical appearance and her visible suffering.",
      "Background": "Notably absent is any blame for the man who caused this suffering. No one is shown pointing to the empty space where her lover should be and saying, 'He forsook her!' ('துறந்தார் அவர் என்பார் இல்'). All the blame and commentary fall solely on the suffering woman."

        "Camera": "A shot from the woman's perspective, showing the pointing fingers and judgmental faces of the crowd, making the viewer feel her isolation and the unfairness of the situation.",
