    "Chapter": "நிலையாமை (Instability)",
    "Tamil_Text": "நில்லாத வற்றை நிலையின என்றுணரும்புல்லறி வாண்மை கடை.",
    "English_Meaning": "That ignorance which considers those things to be stable which are not so, is dishonourable (to the wise)."

  "Flux_Optimized_Prompt": {
    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A foolish person ('புல்லறிவாளர்') is shown desperately trying to build a grand palace using materials that are inherently unstable ('நில்லாதவை'): river mist, shifting sand, and smoke.",
      "Midground": "The palace, despite their efforts, is constantly dissolving and collapsing, representing the futility of believing in the permanence of the impermanent.",
      "Background": "In the distance, a wise sage is shown sitting peacefully, observing this futile act with a compassionate but knowing gaze. The sage is building a small, simple, but solid hut out of stone, representing the recognition of true permanence."
    },
    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "The ultimate folly and baseness ('கடை') of a shallow intellect is to mistake the impermanent for the permanent and to build one's life on that false assumption.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The choice of building materials (mist, sand, smoke) is a direct metaphor for worldly things like youth, wealth, and power. The constant collapse of the palace symbolizes the inevitable failure of a life based on attachment to these things.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Futile, foolish, tragic, deluded.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The foolish person's palace is lit with a deceptive, shimmering, and unstable light. The colors are flashy but insubstantial. The wise sage and their stone hut are in a clear, steady, and honest light.",
      "Technical_Cues": {
        "Camera": "A wide shot that contrasts the frantic, failing efforts of the fool with the calm, successful wisdom of the sage.",
        "Resolution": "8K, ultra-realistic, with advanced particle and fluid dynamics for the mist, sand, and smoke palace.",
        "Lighting": "Unstable, flickering light on the fool's palace versus a constant, serene light on the sage's hut.",
        "Art_Genre": "Surrealist allegorical painting."
