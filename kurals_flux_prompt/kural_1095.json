      "Background": "However, she subtly and secretly turns just one eye ('ஒரு கண்') towards him in a swift, sideways glance. This glance is not a full look, but a slight 'squinting' or partial closing of the eye ('சிறக்கணித்தாள்'), and it is accompanied by a tiny, almost imperceptible smile ('நிரும்'). It is a secret, coded message of love."
