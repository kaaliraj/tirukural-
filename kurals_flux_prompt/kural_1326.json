      "Foreground": "A split composition illustrating a simile about pleasure.",
      "Midground": "On the left, a person is shown first eating a delicious meal ('உணல்'). Then, in a subsequent scene, they are shown resting with a look of deep, serene satisfaction. This feeling of peaceful digestion ('உண்டது அறல்') is shown to be the 'sweeter' pleasure.",
      "Background": "On the right, a couple is first shown in a passionate embrace ('புணர்தல்'). Then, in a subsequent scene, they are engaged in a playful, witty lover's pout ('ஊடல்'). The pleasure on their faces during this pout—the anticipation, the sweet tension—is shown to be even more delightful and 'sweeter' ('இனிது') than the pleasure of the embrace itself."

      "Subject_and_Action": "A sophisticated comparison of pleasure: just as the peaceful satisfaction after a meal is sweeter than the act of eating, the playful tension of a lover's pout is sweeter than the act of union itself.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The hierarchy of pleasure is the key. In both cases, the state of longing and anticipation (pouting) or peaceful aftermath (digestion) is elevated above the moment of direct consummation (eating/union).",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Sophisticated pleasure, anticipation, sweet tension, serene satisfaction.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The lighting should reflect the quality of the pleasure. The act of eating/union is in a bright, passionate light. The state of digestion/pouting is in a deeper, more satisfying, and perhaps more golden, serene light.",
