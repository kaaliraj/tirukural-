      "Midground": "The Earth is personified as a great, patient, divine being ('வையம்'), struggling to bear the immense weight ('பொறை') of this one backbiter.",
      "Background": "The Earth-being is looking up to the heavens, to the personification of Virtue ('அறன்'), with a questioning expression. The image suggests that the only reason the Earth continues to endure this terrible burden is out of some deep, abiding respect for the principle of Virtue or Charity itself ('அறன் நோக்கி ஆற்றுங்கொல்')."
