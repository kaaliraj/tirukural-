      "Foreground": "A woman is shown with her lover, who has just returned. Her heart ('நெஞ்சே') had a plan: to first show dislike and pout ('துனி செய்து'), and then later to enjoy his company ('துவ்வாய்').",
      "Midground": "However, the heart is shown failing at this plan. It is so overwhelmed with joy that it is unable to perform the first part (pouting) and rushes straight to the second part (enjoyment).",
      "Background": "The woman's intellect, personified as a separate, slightly exasperated version of herself, is shown chiding her heart. The intellect's words appear: 'Since you can't even follow a simple plan, who will ever consult with you again?' ('நின்னொடு சூழ்வார் யார்?'). The heart is shown to be too emotional and impulsive for strategic games of love."
