      "Foreground": "A pathetic, isolated figure stands alone on a barren plain, representing a ruler who has failed in every aspect.",
      "Midground": "His weaknesses are visualized around him: his heart is a block of ice, showing he is 'unloving' ('அன்பிலன்'); he has no allies, so the space around him is empty ('துணையிலன்'); and his own body is frail and weak, showing he lacks personal strength ('தான்துவ்வான்').",
      "Background": "Looming on the horizon is a powerful, well-supported enemy army ('ஏதிலான் துப்பு'). The image poses a rhetorical question: how can this isolated, weak, and unloved figure possibly hope to overcome such a mighty foe? The outcome is presented as a foregone conclusion."
