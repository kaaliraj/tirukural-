      "Foreground": "Two figures are falling into a dark, bottomless abyss representing damnation.",
      "Midground": "The first figure has destroyed all other virtues ('எந்நன்றி கொன்றார்')—their path is lined with the wreckage of truth, charity, etc. However, a single, thin thread of light offers them a chance to escape ('உய்வுண்டாம்').",
      "Background": "The second figure has committed only one crime: they have 'killed a benefit'—betrayed a kindness done to them ('செய்ந்நன்றி கொன்ற). For them, there is no thread of light, no hope. The abyss swallows them completely, signifying there is no escape ('உய்வில்லை')."
