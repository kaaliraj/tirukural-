      "Background": "Instead, this day is shown as a day of opportunity and profit. The friend's fault is visualized as a piece of rough, unrefined gold ore. The wise friend is shown taking this 'fault' and using their loyalty and wisdom to refine it into a beautiful, pure gold ingot, strengthening the friendship and the friend's character in the process. The day of the fault becomes a 'good day' ('நாள்')."
