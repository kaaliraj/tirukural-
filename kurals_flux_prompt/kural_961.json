      "Foreground": "A noble figure stands at a crossroads. One path leads to a magnificent throne representing a seemingly indispensable glory ('இன்றி அமையாச் சிறப்பு').",
      "Midground": "However, this path is shown to be a low, degrading, muddy trench that would stain their honor ('குன்ற வருப'). The other path is a simple, clean, but difficult upward path.",
      "Background": "With a resolute expression of honor, the figure unequivocally rejects the easy, muddy path to the throne and chooses the harder but cleaner path, even if it means forgoing the 'indispensable' glory. This choice is to be abandoned ('விடல்')."

      "Subject_and_Action": "A person of honor must reject any action or path that would diminish their high standing, even if it promises an outcome that seems absolutely essential.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The contrast between the high throne and the low, muddy path to reach it is the central metaphor. The act of choosing the clean path, even if it leads to a lesser material outcome, is a testament to the person's unwavering sense of honor.",

      "Lighting_and_Color": "The muddy path and the throne are lit with a deceptive, sickly yellow light. The clean, upward path is bathed in a pure, white light of integrity. The noble figure is illuminated by this light of their own choice.",

        "Camera": "A wide shot that clearly presents the two paths and the noble figure's decisive choice, emphasizing the moral landscape.",
