      "Midground": "With this sword, they are decisively cutting away two monstrous, shadowy chains that bind their soul. One chain is labeled 'I' ('யான்') and the other is labeled 'Mine' ('எனது'). This is the act of destroying the arrogant ego ('செருக்கு அறுப்பான்').",
      "Background": "The moment these two chains are severed, a gateway opens to a world of unimaginable light and bliss. This realm is so high that even the gods ('வானோர்'), who are shown on a lower celestial plane, are looking up at it with awe and longing. It is a 'world higher than the gods' ('வானோர்க்கு உயர்ந்த உலகம்')."
