      "Background": "The army, because it knows the art of war ('தன்மை அறிந்து'), does not break or falter. Instead, it transforms its formation into a solid, immovable wedge that expertly bears the brunt of the dust cloud ('தார் தாங்கி'), weathers the initial shock, and continues its advance ('செல்வது') undeterred."
