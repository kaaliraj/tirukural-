      "Foreground": "A wise and virtuous person ('அறம் பொருள் கண்டார்') is shown walking a straight and clear path.",
      "Midground": "Along the side of the path, a temptation appears: a beautiful woman who is clearly another's wife ('பிறன் பொருளாள்'). This temptation is depicted as a beautiful but dangerous, thorny rose bush blocking a side path.",
      "Background": "The wise person, because of their deep understanding of virtue and property, does not even glance at the temptation. They see the folly ('பேதைமை') of that path and walk straight past it without a moment's hesitation. The desire is completely absent in them ('இல்')."
