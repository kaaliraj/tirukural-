      "Foreground": "A split-screen or time-lapse composition. On the left, a large, vibrant crowd ('அவைக்குழாம்') is eagerly gathering in an ancient Tamil theatre for a dance performance ('கூத்தாட்டு'). This represents the 'acquisition of great wealth' ('பெருஞ்செல்வம்').",
      "Midground": "On the right, the performance is over. The same crowd is now dispersing in all directions, leaving the theatre empty and silent. This represents the 'expenditure or departure of wealth' ('போக்கும்').",
      "Background": "The theatre stage itself represents the individual's life. It is briefly filled with the 'crowd' of wealth, and then just as quickly, it is left empty again."
