      "Foreground": "The poet Thiruvalluvar, or a similar sagely figure, is shown in the posture of a beggar, but he is not begging for himself. He is begging to all other beggars ('இரப்பன் இரப்பாரை எல்லாம்').",
      "Midground": "His plea is visualized: he is pointing towards a mean-spirited, wealthy man who hides his wealth and gives unwillingly ('கரப்பார்'). This unwilling giver is surrounded by a cold, dark aura of refusal.",
      "Background": "The sage is imploring the other beggars to turn away from this cold source and not to debase themselves by asking where there is no grace. The message is, 'Do not beg from them!' ('இரவன்மின்')."

      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Compassionate, guiding, warning, dignified.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The sage is lit with a warm, compassionate light, even in his beggar's pose. The unwilling giver is shrouded in a cold, dark, and selfish shadow.",

        "Camera": "A shot that captures the sage's earnest plea, the group of beggars he is addressing, and the cold, forbidding figure of the one they should not approach.",
