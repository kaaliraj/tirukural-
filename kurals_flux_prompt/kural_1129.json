      "Foreground": "A woman is shown staring intently, without blinking ('இமைப்பின்'). The reason is that her lover resides in her eyes, and she knows a blink would hide him from her view ('கரப்பாக்கு அறிவல்').",
      "Midground": "The people of her town are shown observing her.",
      "Background": "Because they cannot see the lover who lives inside her eyes, they misunderstand her unblinking stare. They are shown whispering and pointing, and their gossip is visualized: 'Her lover must have abandoned her; she is a stranger to him now' ('ஏதிலர் என்னும் இவ் ஊர்'). Her act of supreme intimacy is publicly misinterpreted as a sign of his abandonment."
