      "Background": "In the background, a group of wise sages ('சான்றோர்') are also witnessing this scene. Their faces show an even greater level of disapproval and intellectual pain, as they understand the full depth of the folly and waste. The image poses the question: if it pains his mother this much, how much more must it pain the wise?"
