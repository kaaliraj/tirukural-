      "Foreground": "An ignorant fool ('அறிவிலான்') is shown cheerfully and happily giving a valuable gift to another person ('நெஞ்சுவந்து ஈதல்').",
      "Midground": "The reason for this unexpected generosity is revealed. A golden, divine light of 'good karma' or 'past merit' ('தவம்') is shown descending from the heavens and shining upon the receiver.",
      "Background": "This divine light is what is actually compelling the fool to give the gift. The fool is merely an unconscious instrument of the receiver's own good fortune. There is no other reason for the fool's action ('பிறிதியாதும் இல்லை')."
