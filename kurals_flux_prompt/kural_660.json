      "Foreground": "A person is shown craftily acquiring wealth through deceit, represented by them pulling gold coins out of a shadowy, magical illusion.",
      "Midground": "They then take this ill-gotten wealth and place it for safekeeping ('ஏமார்த்தல்') into a large, beautifully shaped, but clearly unfired, wet clay pot ('பசுமட் கலம்').",
      "Background": "As soon as the wealth (and water, 'நீர்') is placed inside, the unburnt pot begins to dissolve and collapse, and all the wealth spills out and is lost in the mud. The attempt to preserve it has failed completely."

      "Subject_and_Action": "Acquiring wealth by fraud and then trying to secure it is as futile as trying to store water in an unbaked clay pot.",
