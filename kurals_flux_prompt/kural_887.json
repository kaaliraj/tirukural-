      "Foreground": "A family that suffers from internal hatred ('உட்பகை உற்ற குடி') is shown standing together, putting on an appearance of unity for the outside world.",
      "Midground": "Their apparent unity is compared to a beautiful, ornate casket with its lid ('செப்பின் புணர்ச்சி'). The lid fits perfectly on the box, and from the outside, they seem to be a single, unified object.",
      "Background": "However, a surreal, see-through view reveals the truth. Although the lid and box are touching, they are not truly joined. A venomous serpent is coiled in the gap between them, showing that there is no true union ('கூடாதே'), only a dangerous and deceptive surface-level contact."

    "Art_Direction": {
      "Subject_and_Action": "A family with internal hatred, even if they seem to be together, can never be truly united, just as a casket and its lid are two separate things that merely touch.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The casket and lid are the central analogy for a superficial union. The hidden serpent represents the active hatred that prevents true unity.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Superficial, deceptive, disunited, dangerous.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The outside of the casket is beautiful and polished. The interior view reveals the dark, venomous serpent, lit with a sickly, sinister light.",

        "Camera": "A shot that shows the perfect exterior of the casket, with a surreal cutaway to reveal the serpent hidden in the join.",
