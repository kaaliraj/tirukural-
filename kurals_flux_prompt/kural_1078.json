      "Midground": "On the left, a great, virtuous person ('சான்றோர்'). A needy person simply speaks to them ('சொல்ல'). Instantly, the great person produces a stream of golden coins, representing their immediate, willing help.",
      "Background": "On the right, a base person ('கீழ்') who also has wealth. To get any benefit from them, they are shown being crushed like a sugarcane ('கரும்பு போல் கொல்ல') in a massive press. Only under this extreme, destructive pressure do they release a small, grudging trickle of benefit."

      "Subject_and_Action": "A sharp contrast in how to get help from the virtuous and the base: the virtuous give freely when simply told of a need, while the base yield benefit only when crushed and destroyed like a sugarcane.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The willing, golden stream of help from the virtuous contrasts with the forced, painful trickle from the base. The sugarcane press is a direct and visceral metaphor for the violence and pressure required to extract anything from the base.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Willing vs. forced, generous vs. miserly, destructive extraction.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The virtuous scene is bathed in a warm, golden light of generosity. The scene with the base person is dark, violent, and mechanical, lit by the harsh light of the crushing press.",
