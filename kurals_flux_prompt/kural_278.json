      "Background": "A symbolic, transparent view reveals the true state of their mind ('மனத்தது'). While their body is being cleansed by the holy water, their mind is shown as a swamp of black, filthy sludge—it is 'full of filth' ('மாசாக'). The external purity of the water cannot touch the internal corruption."
