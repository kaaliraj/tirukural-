      "Foreground": "A warrior is shown breaking a massive stone boulder with a single, powerful strike. This represents 'Power in Action' ('வினைத்திட்பம்').",
      "Midground": "A transparent, ethereal view into the warrior's mind reveals the true source of this power. Their mind ('மனம்') is depicted not as flesh, but as a solid, unyielding diamond, representing 'Firmness of Mind' ('மனத்திட்பம்').",
      "Background": "Surrounding the warrior are other, secondary tools of power—strong muscles, a sharp sword, heavy armor ('மற்றைய எல்லாம் பிற'). However, they are shown to be mere accessories, while the diamond mind is clearly the core and origin of the power that shatters the rock."
