      "Midground": "On the left, a person is easily and eloquently speaking about a great deed ('சொல்லுதல்'). Their words are visualized as a beautiful, perfectly drawn architectural blueprint for a magnificent temple.",
      "Background": "On the right, the same person is shown actually trying to build the temple according to the blueprint ('சொல்லிய வண்ணம் செயல்'). The task is immensely difficult; they are sweating, straining, and the work is hard ('அரியவாம்'). The gap between the easy plan and the difficult reality is stark."
