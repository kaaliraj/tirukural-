      "Background": "The compassionate person's aura of kindness ('அருள்') acts as a powerful shield. As the dreaded evils reach the edge of this aura, they see the peaceful community of protected beings and they halt, then fade away, unable to proceed. The compassion shown to others has neutralized the evils meant for oneself."
