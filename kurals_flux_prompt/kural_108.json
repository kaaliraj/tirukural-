      "Foreground": "A person's mind is visualized. On the right side, a memory of a good deed ('நன்றி') done to them is being carefully carved into a permanent, golden stone tablet ('மறப்பது நன்றன்று').",
      "Midground": "On the left side, the memory of an injury or a bad deed ('நன்றல்லது') is being written on sand. As it is being written, a gentle wind immediately blows the letters away, causing them to be forgotten instantly ('அன்றே மறப்பது').",
      "Background": "A serene, balanced landscape, representing a well-ordered mind that has achieved peace by practicing this dual discipline of memory."

      "Lighting_and_Color": "The stone tablet of good deeds is bathed in a warm, golden, grateful light. The sand of injuries is in cool, neutral, and forgettable colors. The overall lighting is clear and balanced.",
