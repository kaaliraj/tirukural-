      "Midground": "The other people in the crowd ('அஃதில்லார்'), who lack this inner fire, are shown in a state of transformation. Their skin is turning to bark, their limbs are becoming stiff branches, and their feet are taking root in the ground. They are becoming trees in human form ('மரம் மக்களாதல்').",
