      "Foreground": "A king is shown in his private chambers, enjoying a simple pleasure (like reading a book or listening to music) in a quiet, concealed manner ('காதல் அறியாமை'). A thick, ornate curtain is drawn, hiding him from view.",
      "Midground": "Outside the curtain, enemy spies ('ஏதிலார்') are shown listening intently, but their expressions are confused. The plans and schemes in their hands, represented by scrolls with complex diagrams ('நூல்'), are shown turning to dust, becoming useless because they can find no fault or weakness to exploit.",
      "Background": "The world outside the king's private chambers is depicted as a complex web of intrigue and plotting, which is being rendered harmless by the king's discreet conduct."
