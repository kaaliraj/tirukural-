      "Foreground": "A powerful king is surrounded by a vast and mighty army, with innumerable allies and supports ('இறந்தமைந்த சார்புடையர்'). They seem completely invincible.",
      "Midground": "However, they have earned the wrath ('செறின்') of a single, supremely great and virtuous sage ('சிறந்தமைந்த சீரார்'). The sage is seated in meditation, seemingly doing nothing.",
      "Background": "From the meditating sage, a silent, invisible wave of spiritual power is unleashed. This wave passes through the king and his massive army, causing them all to turn to dust and blow away in the wind. Their immense support was useless; they cannot survive ('உய்யார்')."
