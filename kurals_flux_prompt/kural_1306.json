      "Foreground": "A tree representing Love ('காமம்') is shown.",
      "Midground": "This tree bears two kinds of undesirable fruit. On one branch hangs a sour, unripe, hard fruit ('கருக்காய்'). This represents a relationship with only serious, prolonged dislike ('துனி'). On another branch hangs an overly ripe, mushy, and flavorless fruit ('கனியும்'). This represents a relationship with no pouting or playful variance at all.",
      "Background": "A vision of the perfect fruit of love is shown separately. It is perfectly ripe, a balance between the two extremes, and it is understood that this perfect state is achieved through the correct, balanced application of playful pouting ('புலவி')."

      "Subject_and_Action": "Love without any playful variance or pouting is like a fruit that is bland and overripe. Love that is only full of serious conflict is like a fruit that is hard and unripe. The perfect pleasure requires a balance.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The three types of fruit—unripe, overripe, and perfect—are the central metaphor for the different states of a romantic relationship. The image makes a case for the necessity of playful conflict (pouting) to achieve the perfect flavor.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Balanced, flavorful, cautionary, instructive.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "The unripe fruit is a hard, sour green. The overripe fruit is a dull, mushy brown. The perfect fruit is a vibrant, luscious, and perfectly colored red or gold, glowing with an appetizing light.",
