    "Layered_Composition": {
      "Foreground": "A split-screen composition. On the left, a man lives in a very simple, humble hut. However, his wife ('இல்லவள்') radiates a powerful golden aura of virtue ('மாண்பு'), and because of her, their simple hut is filled with a vision of all worldly and spiritual treasures—knowledge, joy, prosperity.",
      "Midground": "On the right, a man lives in a magnificent palace filled with material wealth. But his wife lacks virtue; she is depicted as a hollow, shadowy figure. Because of her absence of virtue, all the treasures around them are turning to dust and ash.",
      "Background": "The background for the left scene is a beautiful, thriving natural world. The background for the right is a barren, desolate wasteland, reflecting the true state of their lives."

      "Subject_and_Action": "A visual representation of a rhetorical question: A virtuous wife makes a man who has nothing possess everything. An unvirtuous wife makes a man who has everything possess nothing.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The virtuous wife's aura is the source of all light and color on her side of the image. The absence of virtue in the other wife is a void that drains color and life from her side. The key is that the wife's virtue ('மாண்பு') is the sole determinant of true wealth.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Stark contrast, profound truth, spiritual wealth vs. material poverty.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "Dramatic split. The left side is luminous, warm, and vibrant, lit from the wife's inner virtue. The right side is dark, desaturated, and crumbling, with cold, harsh lighting.",
