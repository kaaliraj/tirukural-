      "Foreground": "A split composition illustrating a simile.",
      "Midground": "On the left, a hunter ('வேட்டுவன்') is hiding behind a bush ('புதல் மறைந்து'), using a bird-call to lure and trap innocent birds ('புள் சிமிழ்த்து'). His action is one of deceit for the purpose of destruction.",
      "Background": "On the right, a false ascetic is shown. He is hiding behind the respectable appearance of a holy man ('தவம் மறைந்து'), but he is secretly committing sinful, evil acts ('அல்லவை செய்தல்'). The two actions are presented as morally and methodologically identical."

      "Subject_and_Action": "The act of a false ascetic who hides behind a holy facade to commit sin is exactly the same as a hunter hiding in a bush to trap birds.",
      "Symbolic_Motifs": "The key is the parallel act of 'hiding' for a malicious purpose. The holy robes of the ascetic are equated with the hunter's bush—both are just camouflage for a predatory nature.",
      "Mood_and_Emotion": "Deceitful, predatory, hypocritical, treacherous.",
      "Lighting_and_Color": "Both scenes are depicted with a shadowy, conspiratorial light. The focus is on the act of hiding and the evil intention. The innocence of the victims (the birds, the followers of the ascetic) should be highlighted.",

        "Camera": "A diptych shot that draws a direct, inescapable parallel between the actions of the hunter and the false ascetic.",
